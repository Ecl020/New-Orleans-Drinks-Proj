<p>Hail New Orleans that for more than a century has
 been the home of civilized drinking. From the time of
its settlement by the French, through the dominaton
of the Spanish, and occupation by the Americans after
the Louisiana Purchase, the flowing bowl and the adept
mixing of what went in it has constituted as high an
art in this Creole city as the incomparable cooking for
which it is famed.</p> 

<p>The quality of mixed drinks as served in New Orleans has always appealed to the sophisticated taste, but
the drinks and their histories are forever linked with the
past of this pleasure-loving city out of which has come
so much that is beautiful and gay, and so much that is
worth preserving.</p> 

<p>It was here that your pious Creole lady guilelessly
brewed muscadine wine and blackberry cordial and peach 
brandy chocked with authority. It was here that your 
gentlemen of the old school, more or less pleasantly 
corned in season and out, made a cult of preparing a 
drink and a ritual of downing it. It was here that your 
most modern of American beverages, the cocktail, first 
came into being and was given its jaunty name.</p> 

<p>With a desire to acquaint the world—or that part of 
the world that may be interested—with the art of mixing
a drink as it is done in New Orleans, the author of this
book has cajoled from old and new experts the recipes
handed down through succeeding generations and pre
sents them herein for your delectation with a smile and a
<i>"Sante!"<i></p>

<h3 style = 'text-align : center' ; ">The Birth of the Cocktail</h3 >
	<p>	The most popular alcoholic beverage in the world today is that high-powered mixture known as the Cocktail.
	For a century and beyond this stimulating drink has served to elevate dejected spirits. Born, nurtured, 
	and christened on this side of the Atlantic, it has overflowed its original boundaries, especially since the World War, 
	and today even staid British taste, long wedded to historic brandy and soda, is beginning to find satisfaction—and something 
	else—in the Yankee mixed drink.
	Why is a cocktail called a cocktail.? Why should the rear adornment of a chanticleer be identified with so robust a libation?
	The origin of the cocktail and its singular naming have long been veiled in mystery. One legend sets forth that the French-speaking
		people of Old New Orleans had a word for a favorite drink, and that word eventually was corrupted into "cocktail." Other and more fanciful
		legends have found circulation from time to time but here are the facts concerning the birth of the cocktail and how it received its inapposite name.<p>
	<p>In the year 1793, at the time of the uprising of the blacks on the portion of the island of San Domingo then belonging to France, wealthy white plantation
		owners were forced to flee that favored spot in the sun-lit Caribbean. With them went their precious belongings and heirlooms. Some of the expelled Dominguois 
		who flocked to what was then Spanish Louisiana brought gold to New Orleans. Others brought slaves along with their household goods. Some brought nothing but the 
		clothes they wore upon their backs. One refugee succeeded in salvaging, among other scanty possessions, a
		recipe for the compounding of a liquid tonic, called
		bitters, a recipe that had been a secret family formula
		for years.</p>

<div>
	<footer style="text-align: right">

</div>

<p>This particular young Creole refugee was of a distin
guished French family and had been educated as an
apothecary. His name was Antoine Amedee Peychaud.
In the turmoil of the insurrection and the hurried exodus
from San Domingo, Amedee and his young sister, Last-
henie, became separated. It was not until years later
when he had established himself in New Orleans, that
Ae sister was located in Paris and Peychaud had her
join him in his new home where subsequently she mar
ried into the well-known Maurin family.</p> 

<p>A. A. Peychaud's bid for fame and popularity in the
city of his adoption was founded not so much upon the
quality or profusion of the drugs he dispensed over the
counter of his shop (located in a building still standing
at 437 Royal street) as upon his bitters, a tonic and 
stomachic compounded according to his secret family 
formula. These bitters, good for what ailed one irre
spective of malady, gave an added zest to the potions of
cognac brandy he served friends and others who came
into his pharmacy—especially those in need of a little
brandy, as well as bitters, for their stomach's sake.</p> 
<p>The fame of Peychaud's highly flavored dram of brandy spread rapidly. Consequently the bitters found
a ready market in the numerous coffee houses (as liquid dispensing establishments were then called) that stood 
cheek by jowl in almost every street in old New Orleans. Cognac had long been a popular drink among
the city's experienced bibbers, but presently customers
began demanding their French brandy spiked with a dash or so of the marvelous bitters compounded by M.Peychaud.</p> 

<div>
	<footer style="text-align: left">
		<b><i>Ten</i></b> 
	</footer>
</div>

<p>In his own place of business Peychaud had a unique way of serving his 
spiced drink of brandy. He poured portions into what we now call an 
"egg-cup"—the old-fashioned double-end egg-cup. This particular piece
 of crockery, known to the French-speaking population as a coquetier> 
 (pronounced ko-k-tay), was, in all probability, forerunner of the present 
 jigger—the name given the double-end metal contraption holding a jigger
  (1.5 ounces) in the big end, and a pony (1 ounce) in the little end, 
  which we now use to measure portions for mixed drinks.<p>



<p>It is not surprising that those whose French pronunciation was 
imperfect were soon calling the spiced drink they quaffed from 
the big end of the crockery cup a "cock-tay." Possibly through 
sampling too many of M. Peychaud's spiced brandies, the thickened
tongues of the imbibers slurred the word into "cocktail."<p>

<p>Presently all New Orleans was drinking brandy-cocktails, quite dissimilar 
indeed from the usual brandy-toddies heretofore served exclusively in most 
of the coffee houses of old New Orleans. The bitters made the difference.<p>

<p>In such fashion did Peychaud's original San Domingo</p> 
<p>bitters give an otherwise simple brandy-toddy new life</p> 
<p>and zest. In such fashion did the inconspicuous little</p> 
<p>crockery coquetier or egg-cup become the christening</p> 
<p>font of the cocktail.</p> 
<p>Many have been the yarns setting forth the correct</p> 
<p>etymology of the word "cocktail." Some of these legends</p> 
<p>are picturesque, some old, some modern, many fantas</p> 
<p>tic, and most of them far-fetched and meaningless.</p> 

<p>Eleven</p> 

<p>The word was not accepted by lexicographers until</p> 

<p>about the beginning of the present century, each pupdit</p> 

<p>advancing a different version as to its origin. Dr. Frank</p> 

<p>H. Vizetelly, noted editor of the Standard Dictionary</p> 

<p>and authority on words, writes me;</p> 

<p>The cocktail goes back at least to the beginning of</p> 

<p>the 19th century, and may date back to the American</p> 

<p>Revolution. It is alleged by one writer to have been a</p> 

<p>concoction prepared by the widow of a Revolutionary</p> 

<p>soldier as far back at 1779. He offers no proof of the</p> 

<p>statement, but a publication. The Balance, for May 13,</p> 

<p>1806, describes the cocktail ofthat period as 'a stimulating</p> 

<p>liquor composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and</p> 

<p>bitters. It is vulgarly called hitter sling, and is supposed</p> 

<p>to be an excellent electioneering potion.'</p> 

<p>"Washington Irving in Knickerbocker (1809), page</p> 

<p>241, said of the cocktail-'They (Dutch-Americans) lay</p> 

<p>claim to be the first inventors of the recondite beverages,</p> 

<p>cock'tail, stone-fence, and sherry-cobbler.' Hawthorne re</p> 

<p>ferred to cocktails in The Blithedale Romance (1852),</p> 

<p>as did Thackeray in his The Newcomes (1854), but</p> 

<p>neither of these authors shed any light upon the origin</p> 

<p>of the term.</p> 

<p>The New England Dictionary on Historical Princi</p> 

<p>ples says that the origin of the word cocktail is lost. In</p> 

<p>this connection one writer refers to the older term cock</p> 

<p>tail, meaning a horse whose tail, being docked, sticks</p> 

<p>up like the tail of a cock. He adds: 'Since drinkers</p> 

<p>of cocktails believe them to be exhilarating, the recently</p> 

<p>popular song "Horsy, keep your tail up," may perhaps</p> 

<p>hint at a possible connection between the two senses of</p> 

<p>"cocktail".'</p> 

<p>T welve</p> 

<p>"Bartlett in his Dictionary of Americanisms gives the</p> 

<p>following: 'Cocktail. A stimulating beverage, made of</p> 

<p>brandy, gin, or other liquor, mixed with bitters, sugar</p> 

<p>and a very little water. A friend thinks this term was</p> 

<p>suggested by the shape which the froth, as a glass of</p> 

<p>porter, assumes when it flows over the sides of a tumbler</p> 

<p>containing the liquid effervescing.' He quotes the fol</p> 

<p>lowing from the New Yor\ Tribune of May 8, 1862: 'A</p> 

<p>bowie-knife and a foaming cocktail.' In Yorkshire dia</p> 

<p>lect, cocktail describes beer that is fresh and foaming.</p> 

<p>"Brewer in A Dictionary of Phrase-and Fable, follow</p> 

<p>ing the definition of cocktail, adds the note: 'The origin</p> 

<p>of the term is unknown: the story given in the New</p> 

<p>York World (1891) to the effect that it is an Aztec</p> 

<p>word, and that "the liquor was discovered by a Toltec</p> 

<p>noble, who sent it by the hand of his daughter Xochitl,"</p> 

<p>to the king who promptly named it "xoctl," whence</p> 

<p>"cocktail" is a good specimen of the manufacture of</p> 

<p>popular etymologies.'</p> 

<p>"As you will see from the foregoing, altho many</p> 

<p>theories have been advanced as to the ctymoloey of the</p> 

<p>term cocktail, these, like most etvmologies of the kind,</p> 

<p>are mere flights of fancy, and while they make interest</p> 

<p>ing reading, cannot be accepted as reliable."</p> 

<p>After careful analysis of Doctor Vizetelly's data it ap</p> 

<p>pears to be certain that the odd mispronunciation of</p> 

<p>coquetier in New Orleans is the oldest and most positive</p> 

<p>basis for the word "cocktail."</p> 

<p>Monsieur Peychaud, glass in hand we salute you? A</p> 

<p>votre santSl</p> 

<p>An interesting tale bearing upon the use of the word</p> 

<p>cocktail in Old New Orleans is to be found in a book</p> 

<p>written by a German traveler over a century ago. The</p> 

<p>author was Henry Didimus, and his book. New Orleans</p> 

<p>Thirteen</p> 

<p>As I Saw It, tells of his adventures in the Crescent City</p> 

<p>in the winter of 1835-36 at which time he became ac</p> 

<p>quainted with the then famed brandy-cocktail.</p> 

<p>Herr Didimus writes of wandering about the old town</p> 

<p>and of meeting up with three worthies . . . "one played</p> 

<p>the fiddle, another beat the drum, and the third dealt</p> 

<p>out nectar in the form of brandy-cocktail." Didimus</p> 

<p>says he repeated the name, "brandy-cocktail" when such</p> 

<p>a drink was suggested, so as to gain the attention of the</p> 

<p>third worthy who thereupon said: "Ah, I see; not ac</p> 

<p>quainted with the mixture," and led the way to a refresh</p> 

<p>ment place. When all were seated about a table, the</p> 

<p>third worthy yelled: "Boy, bring up four glasses of</p> 

<p>brandy-cocktails!"</p> 

<p>The black slave vanished and returned with four tumb</p> 

<p>lers practically filled, each of Didimus' companions</p> 

<p>seized a glass, and eyes shining with anticipation, glasses</p> 

<p>were touched, and the drinks were downed.</p> 

<p>Herr Didimus, immensely pleased with what the draft</p> 

<p>did to his insides, demanded to be told in what way a</p> 

<p>brandy-co<r/^toz7 differed from a brandy-^oi^y?</p> 

<p>"The difference between a brandy-cocktail and a</p> 

<p>brandy-toddy is this," explained the loquacious worthy.</p> 

<p>"A brandy-toddy is made by adding together a little</p> 

<p>water, a little sugar, and a great deal of brandy—mix</p> 

<p>well and drink. A brandy-cocktail is composed of the</p> 

<p>same ingredients, with the addition of a shade of bitters</p> 

<p>—sothatthebittersdrawthelineofdemarkation. Boy!"</p> 

<p>he bellowed, "bring up four brandy-toddies—you shall</p> 

<p>taste the difierence, sir!"</p> 

<p>Fourteen</p> 

<p>"Whisf{ie shallput our brainsin rage." 1715</p> 

<p>Whiskey Drinks</p> 

<p>Whiskey is a potent drink and whiskey is a potent</p> 

<p>word—^perhaps because both are of Irish extraction. The</p> 

<p>English pronunciation of the word in use today is based</p> 

<p>upon a word the ancient Gaels applied to the product of</p> 

<p>their stills, for it appears they were the original whiskey-</p> 

<p>makers.</p> 

<p>The name they gave the distilled spirit was singularly</p> 

<p>fitting they called it uisgebeatha. If we dissect the</p> 

<p>word we find that uisge (pronounced oosh'gee) means</p> 

<p>"water," beatha means "life," and the two combined mean</p> 

<p>"water of life." All of which goes to prove you can't</p> 

<p>beat the Irish for apt naming. In time this potent pro</p> 

<p>duct of Ould Ireland's stills became "whiskbae," later</p> 

<p>"whiskie," and finally just plain "whiskey."</p> 

<p>The Scots likewise were distillers of this ancient and</p> 

<p>honorable liquid. They adopted the original name the</p> 

<p>Irish gave to the white spirit which flowed from their</p> 

<p>stills, the word going through a similar sequence of pro</p> 

<p>nunciation until it became "whisky" without the e — note</p> 

<p>spelling on any bottle of Scotch.</p> 

<p>We have much for which to thank the Irish, but whis</p> 

<p>key rates a top place on the list. A toast to the Irish!</p> 

<p>And what drink may better serve such purpose than one</p> 

<p>of the many whiskey cocktails mixed to perfection as</p> 

<p>in New Orleans ? Make it an Old Fashioned, a Sazerac,</p> 

<p>a Manhattan, a julep, a highball, or just plain whiskey.</p> 

<p>Whichever it may be, fill 'em up and drink 'em down</p> 

<p>to the original whiskey-makers—the Irish!</p> 

<p>"Whis^ee—Pa! Give me a Glass of that Rhenish!" 1753</p> 

<p>Fifteen</p> 

<p>Highballs</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey,</p> 

<p>or,</p> 

<p>Bourbon whiskey,</p> 

<p>Scotch whisky,</p> 

<p>Irish whiskey,</p> 

<p>cognac brandy,</p> 

<p>applejack,</p> 

<p>gin,</p> 

<p>• rum.</p> 

<p>fizz water</p> 

<p>ice</p> 

<p>The dictionary lowdown on highball: "a long drink</p> 

<p>of diluted spirits, usually whiskey, served in a tall glass</p> 

<p>with cracked ice."</p> 

<p>Like all popular drinks, the highball is conspicuous</p> 

<p>for its variety. Any spirituous liquor will answer—it</p> 

<p>depends upon individual preference. Some like rye with</p> 

<p>seltzer water, some Bourbon; others hold that the spirit</p> 

<p>of the drink should be Scots whisky, and still others de</p> 

<p>mand Irish whiskey. Brandy, rum, applejack, all have</p> 

<p>their advocates, and there are even benighted souls who</p> 

<p>crave gin in their highballs.</p> 

<p>As they used to say out West: "Name your own poison,</p> 

<p>gents!"</p> 

<p>For the fizz accompaniment use whichever of these</p> 

<p>appeals to you—seltzer, club soda, white rock, ginger ale,</p> 

<p>coca cola, seven-up. Connoisseurs, as a rule, insist that</p> 

<p>only cold water be poured upon their whiskey.</p> 

<p>Sixteen</p> 

<p>The Sazerac Cocktoil</p> 

<p>Oldtimers will tell you the three outstanding drinks</p> 

<p>of New Orleans in the memory of living men were the</p> 

<p>dripped absinthe frappe of the Old Absinthe House,</p> 

<p>the Ramos gin fizz, and the Sazerac cocktail.</p> 

<p>As previously related, the American cocktail was not</p> 

<p>only born in Old New Orleans but was given its curious</p> 

<p>name in the city's famous Vieux Carre. There are cock</p> 

<p>tails and cocktails but the best known of all New Or</p> 

<p>leans cocktails is unquestionably the Sazerac. The fact</p> 

<p>that it originated in New Orleans gave rise to the legend</p> 

<p>that it was first concocted by and named for an old Loui</p> 

<p>siana family, legend without fact as no such Louisiana</p> 

<p>family ever existed.</p> 

<p>A barbershop now holds forth in a building on the</p> 

<p>right hand side of the first block in Royal street going</p> 

<p>down from Canal, and before its doors, still remains</p> 

<p>lettered in the sidewalk the word "SAZERAC." This</p> 

<p>denotative indicated the entranceway to a once well-</p> 

<p>patronized bar on the Exchange Alley side of the build</p> 

<p>ing. It was here the drink famed far and wide as a</p> 

<p>Sazerac cocktail was mixed and dispensed. It was here</p> 

<p>it was christened with the name it now bears.</p> 

<p>For years one of the favorite brands of cognac imported</p> 

<p>Seventeen</p> 

<p>into New Orleans was a brand manufactured by the</p> 

<p>firm of Sazerac-de-Forge et fils, of Limoges, France. The</p> 

<p>local agent for this firm was John B. Schiller. In 1859</p> 

<p>Schiller opened a liquid dispensary at 13 Exchange Alley,</p> 

<p>naming it "Sazerac Coffee-house" after the brand of</p> 

<p>cognac §erved exclusively at his bar.</p> 

<p>Schiller's brandy cocktails became the drink of the</p> 

<p>day and his business flourished, surviving even the War</p> 

<p>Between the States. In 1870 Thomas H. Handy, his</p> 

<p>bookkeeper, succeeded as proprietor and changed the</p> 

<p>name to "Sazerac House." An alteration in the mixture</p> 

<p>also took place. Peychaud's bitters was still used to add</p> 

<p>the right fillip, but American rye whiskey was substi</p> 

<p>tuted for the cognac to please the tastes of Americans</p> 

<p>who preferred "red likker" to any pale-faced brandy.</p> 

<p>Thus brandy vanished from the Sazerac cocktail to</p> 

<p>be replaced by whiskey (Handy always used Maryland</p> 

<p>Club rye, if you are interested in brand names), and the</p> 

<p>dash of absinthe was added. Precisely when whiskey</p> 

<p>replaced brandy and the dash of absinthe added are</p> 

<p>moot questions. The absinthe innovation has been</p> 

<p>credited to Leon Lamothe who in 1858 was a bartender</p> 

<p>for Emile Seignouret, Charles Cavaroc &Co., a wine im</p> 

<p>porting firm located in the old Seignouret mansion still</p> 

<p>standing at 520 Royal street. More likely it was about</p> 

<p>1870, when Lamothe was employed at Pina's restaurant</p> 

<p>in Burgundy street that he experimented with absinthe</p> 

<p>and made the Sazerac what it is today.</p> 

<p>But this history delving is dry stuff, so let's sample a</p> 

<p>genuine Sazerac. We will ask Leon Dupont, now vice-</p> 

<p>president of the St. Regis Restaurant but for years one</p> 

<p>of the expert cocktail mixers behind Tom Handy's origi</p> 

<p>nal Sazerac bar, to make one for us.</p> 

<p>Eighteen</p> 

<p>Here's how—and how! 3>iO</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>3 drops Peychaud's bitters</p> 

<p>1 dash Angostura hitters</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>1 dash absinthe substitute</p> 

<p>1 slice lemon peel</p> 

<p>To mix a Sazerac requires two heavy-bottomed, 3J^-ounce bar</p> 

<p>glasses. One is filled with cracked ice and allowed to chill. In</p> 

<p>the other a lump of sugar is placed with. just enough water to</p> 

<p>moisten it. The saturated loaf of sugar is then crushed with a</p> 

<p>barspoon. Add a few drops of Peychaud's hitters, a dash of</p> 

<p>^gostura, a jigger of rye whiskey, for. while Bourbon may do</p> 

<p>tor a julep it just won't do for a real Sazerac. To the glass con</p> 

<p>taining sugar, bitters, and rye add several lumps of ice and stir.</p> 

<p>Never use a shaker! Empty the first glass of its ice, dash in</p> 

<p>several drops of absinthe, twirl the glass and shake out the</p> 

<p>absinthe . . . enough will cling to the glass to give the needed</p> 

<p>flavor. Strain into this glass the whiskey mixture, twist a piece</p> 

<p>of lemon peel over it for the needed zest of that small drop of</p> 

<p>oil thus extracted from the peel, but do not commit the sacrilege</p> 

<p>of dropping the peel into the drink. Some bartenders put a cherry</p> 

<p>in a Sazerac; very pretty hut not necessary.</p> 

<p>M-m-m-m-m! Let's have another, Leon!</p> 

<p>Kentucky Whiskey Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 jigger Bourbon whiskey</p> 

<p>1 jigger unsweetened pineapple juice</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>Dissolve the sugar in the pineapple juice. Pour in the jigger of</p> 

<p>Bourbon. Then some lumps of ice. Stir. Strain in serving glass.</p> 

<p>This cocktail could be made with rye whiskey, but</p> 

<p>then you'd not be privileged to attach the name Ken</p> 

<p>tucky to it. Some make the same drink with orange</p> 

<p>juice instead of pineapple, and some use sweetened pine</p> 

<p>apple juice. If the latter, be wary of the amount of</p> 

<p>sugar you use.</p> 

<p>Nineteen</p> 

<p>Old Fashioned Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>2 dashes Peychaud or Angostura bitters</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>1 piece lemon peel</p> 

<p>1 chunk pineapple</p> 

<p>1 slice orange peel</p> 

<p>2 maraschino cherries</p> 

<p>Into a heavy-bottomed barglass drop a lump of sugar, dash on</p> 

<p>the bitters, and crush with a spoon. Pour in the jigger of rye</p> 

<p>whiskey and stir with several lumps of ice. No shaking allowed!</p> 

<p>Let the mixture remain in the glass in which it is prepared. Gar</p> 

<p>nish with a half-ring of orange peel, add the chunk of pineapple,</p> 

<p>and the cherries with a little of the maraschino juice. Twist the</p> 

<p>slice oflemon peel over all and serve in the mixing glass with the</p> 

<p>barspoon.</p> 

<p>Old Fashioned? Yea, verily, but as appealing to smart</p> 

<p>tastes now as on that certain Derby Day a half century</p> 

<p>ago when the originator, whoever he may have been,</p> 

<p>first stirred it into being at the Pendennis Club, in Louis</p> 

<p>ville, Kentucky.</p> 

<p>The Old Fashioned has been a New Orleans institu</p> 

<p>tion for many years and when other whiskey mixtures,</p> 

<p>garnished with fancy names, have passed on and been</p> 

<p>forgotten, the Old Fashioned will continue to tickle ex</p> 

<p>perienced palates. Don't let anyone tell you that gin,</p> 

<p>rum, or brandy can take the place of whiskey in an Old</p> 

<p>Fashioned. Turn a deaf ear to such heresy. A real Old</p> 

<p>Fashioned demands rye whiskey. Remember, Bourbon</p> 

<p>won't do.</p> 

<p>In the old days before the Great Mistake the Old</p> 

<p>Fashioned contained less fruit than it does today. How-</p> 

<p>beit, the expert barkeep of pre-prohibition days never</p> 

<p>neglected to twist a slice of lemon peel over the glass be</p> 

<p>fore serving.</p> 

<p>Twenty</p> 

<p>Blue Blazer</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>1 jigger Scotch whisky</p> 

<p>1 jigger hot water</p> 

<p>Have two mugs, earthenware or metal, and in one dissolve the</p> 

<p>lump of sugar in the hot water. Now add the Scots whisky; be</p> 

<p>sure it's a good brand with plenty of alcoholic content for it has</p> 

<p>to burn. Ignite the mixture. Hold the burning mug in one</p> 

<p>hand, then empty the fluid rapidly from one container to the</p> 

<p>other so that a streak of blue flame connects the two. ^rve in</p> 

<p>a hot-drink glass after twisting a bit of lemon peel over the mix</p> 

<p>ture and topping with a grating of nutmeg.</p> 

<p>If you have cold feet, chattering teeth, shivers, frozen</p> 

<p>fingers, or chilblains, in other words, if you're cold, and</p> 

<p>want to warm up the inner man, you can do no better</p> 

<p>than thaw out with a Blue Blazer.</p> 

<p>This drink was a popular tipple aboard the palatial</p> 

<p>paddle-wheeled steamboats that churned the waters of</p> 

<p>the Mississippi during the time the Natchez and t^e</p> 

<p>Robert E. Lee made history in upstream races to Samt</p> 

<p>Louis. The barkeeps were expert in transferrmg the</p> 

<p>blue-flamed liquid from one mug to another, accom</p> 

<p>plishing the feat with an agility that kept the flames</p> 

<p>from singeing their walrus-like moustaches. You c^</p> 

<p>do the same, (with or wihtout the moustaches) but be</p> 

<p>cautious; if any of this hot Scotch gets on your fingers</p> 

<p>they'll burn like blue blazes!</p>

<p>Manhattan Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>1 dash Angostura bitters</p> 

<p>'/2 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>Vi jigger Italian vermouth</p> 

<p>1 slice lemon peel</p> 

<p>Drop a lump of sugar in a barglass, moisten with a very little</p> 

<p>water, dash on it the two bitters and crush with a barspoon. Add</p> 

<p>Ae rye whiskey (don't use Bourbon) and then the vermouth.</p> 

<p>Drop several lumps of ice into the glass and stir. After straining</p> 

<p>into the cocktail glass, twist a bit of lemon peel over the mixture</p> 

<p>to extract the atom of oil, drop in a maraschino cherry with a</p> 

<p>very httle of the sirup.</p> 

<p>There are almost as many recipes for a real Manhattan</p> 

<p>cocktail as there are skyscrapers in Little Old New York,</p> 

<p>or ways of getting into heaven. The Manhattan, origi-</p> 

<p>nated at the old Delmonico Restaurant in New York</p> 

<p>during the bibulous 90's, was composed of one-third</p> 

<p>Italian vermouth, and two-thirds Bourbon whiskey. Nat-</p> 

<p>^ally, the formula has been improved upon in New</p> 

<p>Orleans; you 11 note we always improve upon things to</p> 

<p>eat and drink in this New Orleans. Just an old Southern</p> 

<p>custom!</p> 

<p>The Manhattan as served over the better New Orleans</p> 

<p>bars has always had that certain something it lacks else</p> 

<p>where. Reason: in first-class establishments the mixol</p> 

<p>ogists use rye for the whiskey and the drink is stirred—</p> 

<p>never shaken. Properly mixed with good brands of</p> 

<p>hquor, the Manhattan is one of the finest drinks that</p> 

<p>flourishes under the name of cocktail, and well deserves</p> 

<p>the reputation that "it is the most popular cocktail in</p> 

<p>the world."</p> 

<p>Twenty-two</p> 

<p>Dry Manhattan</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>1 dash Angostura bitters</p> 

<p>1/3 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>1/3 jigger Italian vermouth</p> 

<p>1/3 jigger French vermouth</p> 

<p>1 slice lemon peel</p> 

<p>This is mixed exactly as is the Manhattan. Must not be shaken—</p> 

<p>a brisk stirring with large lumps of ice is the proper procedure.</p> 

<p>Fine or crushed ice has a tendency to make drinks cloudy and</p> 

<p>whiskey cocktails should have a clear amber color. Put a cherry</p> 

<p>in the cocktail glass before straining in the mixture.</p> 

<p>There are cocktail quaflers who object to the sweet</p> 

<p>ness of the Manhattan made in the orthodox manner and</p> 

<p>prefer a dry Manhattan. The dryer drink is made by</p> 

<p>using a third of a jigger each of the rye, the Italian, and</p> 

<p>the French vermouths. When dropping the cherry into</p> 

<p>the cocktail glass do not include any of the sirup.</p> 

<p>Whiskey Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>6-7 drops Angostura bitters</p> 

<p>5-6 drops Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon curajao</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>Use a heavy-bottomed barglass and drop in a lump of sugar.</p> 

<p>Moisten with a little water, add the two bitters, then ^sh with</p> 

<p>a spoon. Put in the curagao, then the jigger of rye, and stir with</p> 

<p>several lumps of ice. Strain into the serving glass. Finally ^ist</p> 

<p>a sliver of lemon peel over the mixture. That adds the uny drop</p> 

<p>of oil necessary for the perfect result.</p> 

<p>The whiskey cocktail is one of the old-time appetizer</p> 

<p>drinks masquerading under a variety of names in dif</p> 

<p>ferent parts of the country. Follow this recipe and you</p> 

<p>will agree it's a cocktail deserving its wide popularity.</p> 

<p>Twenty-three</p> 

<p>Cocktail a la Louisiane</p> 

<p>1/3 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>1/3 jigger Italian vermouth</p> 

<p>1/3 jigger Benedictine</p> 

<p>3-4 dashes absinthe substitute</p> 

<p>3-4 dashes Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>Mx in barglass with lumps of ice. Strain into a cocktail glass</p> 

<p>in which has been placed a maraschino cherry.</p> 

<p>This is the special cocktail served at RestuuTunt de lu</p> 

<p>Louisiune, one of the famous French restaurants of New</p> 

<p>Orleans, long the rendezvous of those who appreciate</p> 

<p>the best in Creole cuisine. La Louisiane cocktail is as</p> 

<p>out-of-the-ordinary as the many distinctive dishes that</p> 

<p>grace its menu.</p> 

<p>Orange Whiskey Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>1 jigger orange juice</p> 

<p>1 jigger charged water</p> 

<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>Mix the ingredients in a barglass, pour into a shaker with crushed</p> 

<p>ice and shake vigorously. Strain into chilled cocktail glass.</p> 

<p>Prepare in generous quantities, for your guests will offer their</p> 

<p>glasses for more.</p> 

<p>While rye is indicated in the recipe you may substitute</p> 

<p>Bourbon if that is your choice ... but sidestep Scotch</p> 

<p>or Irish. The addition of the carbonated water gives</p> 

<p>this one a little more sparkle than if you use plain water.</p> 

<p>The same cocktail can be made by substituting Orange</p> 

<p>Wine for the orange juice. In some New Orleans homes</p> 

<p>the celebrated Louisiana Orange Wine, made in the</p> 

<p>orange groves below the city, is used in preference to the</p> 

<p>plain orange juice. Many experts prefer Bourbon to rye</p> 

<p>in this particular cocktail.</p> 

<p>Ttventy-jour</p> 

<p>Place d'Armes Cocktail</p> 

<p>54 orange—^juice only</p> 

<p>Yz lemon—juice only</p> 

<p>Yz lime—juice only</p> 

<p>1 pony grenadine sirup</p> 

<p>1 jigger whiskey</p> 

<p>Squeeze the fruit juices in a mixing glass. Add the sirup; be</p> 

<p>careful not to make it too sweet if you like a dry drink . . .</p> 

<p>Otherwise use a little sugar. Then add the whiskey—some prefer</p> 

<p>Bourbon, others rye. Rye is usually better in any mixed drink.</p> 

<p>Strain into a tall glass half-filled with crushed ice. Decorate with</p> 

<p>a sprig of mint, after frapp^ing well with a spoon.</p> 

<p>Of course, this gallant cocktail might be called a Jack</p> 

<p>son Square as readily as a Place d'Armes or, if you speak</p> 

<p>Spanish, how about Plaza de Armas? But its originator</p> 

<p>called it a Place d'Armes, and we'll stick to that. It was</p> 

<p>so named in honor of the grassy tree-shaded square front</p> 

<p>ing the Cathedral and the Cabildo, where General An</p> 

<p>drew Jackson sits astride a rearing battle steed, holding</p> 

<p>aloft his chapeau in perpetual politeness. He would have</p> 

<p>enjoyed this cocktail!</p> 

<p>Twenty-five</p> 

<p>Roffignac Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 jigger whiskey</p> 

<p>1 pony sirup</p> 

<p>seltzer or soda water</p> 

<p>ra§pberry sirup</p> 

<p>Pour into a highball glass the jigger of whiskey (or use cognac,</p> 

<p>as in the original drink). Add the sirup, which may be rasp-</p> 

<p>berry, grenadine, or. red Hembarig, the sweetening used in New</p> 

<p>Orleans a century ago. Add the soda water. Ice, of course.</p> 

<p>Joseph Rofl&gnac, before he fled his native land of</p> 

<p>France at the time of the Revolution, was Count Louis</p> 

<p>Philippe Joseph de Roffignac. In time he became a lead</p> 

<p>ing merchant in New Orleans, the city of his adoption,</p> 

<p>and its mayor for eight years. He fought the British</p> 

<p>under "Old Hickory" at the Battle of New Orleans,</p> 

<p>served in the state legislature, and was a banker of note.</p> 

<p>As mayor he introduced street lighting, and laid the first</p> 

<p>cobblestones in Royal street. For all his many honors,</p> 

<p>Roffignac's name comes to us through the years linked</p> 

<p>with a favorite tipple of Old New Orleans—the Roffig</p> 

<p>nac.</p> 

<p>While not so celebrated as A. A. Peychaud's cocktail,</p> 

<p>it was equally potent. The red Hembarig mentioned</p> 

<p>in the directions for mixing was a popular sirup when</p> 

<p>old New Orleans was young.</p> 

<p>Twenty-six</p> 

<p>"An Ordinary Virginian rises about six o'cloc\. He then drin\s</p> 

<p>a julep made of rum, and sugar but very strong." 1787.</p> 

<p>Juleps</p> 

<p>The word Julep is an old and honored one and can</p> 

<p>be traced as far back as A. D. 1400—long before we ever</p> 

<p>heard oftheSouthernStatesoftheseUnitedStates,where</p> 

<p>the julep is popularly supposed to be indigenous.</p> 

<p>For centuries the julep has been described as "some</p> 

<p>thing to cool or assuage the heat of passion," and "a</p> 

<p>sweet drink prepared in different ways." We know noth</p> 

<p>ing of the first definition but will confirm the second</p> 

<p>statement that it can be made in different ways.</p> 

<p>The earliest form of the word was iulep. Arabs called</p> 

<p>it julab, the Portuguese julepe, the Italians giulehhe,</p> 

<p>Latins named it julapium, Persians, gul-ab, meaning</p> 

<p>"rose water." The Greeks, alas, did not have a word</p> 

<p>for it! ]ulep, as we spell it, is French. All this being</p> 

<p>settled, let us get on with our juleping.</p> 

<p>Don't use rye whiskey in making a julep. If you do</p> 

<p>use whiskey let it be Bourbon, which serves its highest</p> 

<p>purpose when it becomes a component part of that</p> 

<p>prince of all thirst-quenchers known as the Mint Julep.</p> 

<p>There are many kinds of mint juleps, one for nearly</p> 

<p>every Southern State—such as Kentucky, Georgia, Vir</p> 

<p>ginia, Maryland, Louisiana juleps. We give several of</p> 

<p>the most popular recipes.</p> 

<p>"The first thing he did upon getting out of bed was to call for</p> 

<p>a fulep and I date my own love for whiskey from mixing and</p> 

<p>tasting my young master's juleps." 1804.</p> 

<p>Twenty-seven</p> 

<p>Mint Julep</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 

<p>1 dozen mint leaves</p> 

<p>1 jigger Bourbon whiskey</p> 

<p>1 j)ony nun</p> 

<p>Put the mint leaves into a tall glass in which the julep is to be</p> 

<p>served. Add the sugar and crush in a little water. Pour in the</p> 

<p>Bourbon whiskey, then the rum, and fill the glass with shaved</p> 

<p>ice. Jiggle the mixture with a long-handled spoon (do not stir)</p> 

<p>until the outside of the glass or metal goblet is heavily frosted.</p> 

<p>Arrange a bouquet of several sprigs of mint on top just before</p> 

<p>handing to the recipient, who will ever after bless you.</p> 

<p>Naturally, one is aware that he takes his life in his</p> 

<p>hands by even suggesting the way a real mint julep should</p> 

<p>be prepared, for there are as many recipes for this truly</p> 

<p>Southern drink as there are southern states in the Union.</p> 

<p>Julep experts—may their tribe never decrease!—know</p> 

<p>that correctand authenticrecipes take on changesin pass</p> 

<p>ing from one state to another. Southern colonels, to say</p> 

<p>nothing of majors, captains, and buck privates, have been</p> 

<p>known to call for pistols under the duelling oaks when</p> 

<p>it is even hinted that mint leaves be crushed in prepar</p> 

<p>ing a julep. Other colonels, majors, etc., emit fire and</p> 

<p>brimstone, and a Bourbon-laden breath, if the pungent</p> 

<p>leaves are not crushed in the bottom of the glass and a</p> 

<p>bouquet of short-to-measure sprigs placed on top in</p> 

<p>which to snuggle the nose while the nectar is being</p> 

<p>withdrawn with a reverent, albeit, audible sucking</p> 

<p>through a straw.</p> 

<p>There is also a difference of opinion concerning the</p> 

<p>variety of spirits that go into the making. In the recipe</p> 

<p>above the pony of rum may be added or subtracted—it</p> 

<p>all depends on your drinking mathematics. Rum, how</p> 

<p>ever, gives added zest to a regulation whiskey julep.</p> 

<p>Twenty-eight</p> 

<p>The one thing upon which the two mint julep schools</p> 

<p>are fully agreed is this: it was a julep the two C^ohna</p> 

<p>governors had in mind when making ^eir celebrated</p> 

<p>observation regarding the length of time between drmks.</p> 

<p>Kentucky Mint Julep</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>? sprigs of mint leaves</p> 

<p>? jiggers Bourbon whiskey.</p> 

<p>Note the absence of the amount of Boujon to be used—th^'s</p> 

<p>important in a julep, no matter from w at which must</p> 

<p>that is lacking in the above recipe is the shaved ice whiA must</p> 

<p>go il £ Ilass or metal goblet in which the ,ulep is com</p> 

<p>pounded.</p> 

<p>While Georgia may be able to make gwd the boast</p> 

<p>that the mint julep originated within her ^</p> 

<p>appears to be no successful refutation of Kentucky s</p> 

<p>claim that the Blue Grass State</p> 

<p>drink. However divided ^J</p> 

<p>leaves should be crushed or merely dunked, one ^ng</p> 

<p>is certain-no Kentucky gentleman, far less a Kenmcky</p> 

<p>colonel, would ever sanction a recipe which placed</p> 

<p>limitations on the amount of Bourbon that goes into the</p> 

<p>making.</p> 

<p>Nor will we here entangle ourselves in the age-long</p> 

<p>controversy-should a julep be sucked through a straw</p> 

<p>or drunk from the container? Kentuckians vociferously</p> 

<p>maintain that the use of astraw rums ajulep. We have</p> 

<p>tried Kentucky julep with a straw and without both</p>

<p>On one of his many visits to New Orleans "Marse</p> 

<p>Henry" Watterson, one-time beloved editor of the Louis-</p> 

<p>T wenty-nine</p> 

<p>ville Courier-Journal, told a young newspaper reporter</p> 

<p>his recipe for a real Kentucky mint julep.</p> 

<p>"Take a silver goblet, son, one that will hold at least</p> 

<p>a pmt, and dissolve a lump of loaf sugar in it with not</p> 

<p>more than a tablespoon of water. Take one mint leaf,</p> 

<p>no more, and crush it gently between the thumb and</p> 

<p>orefinger before dropping it into the dissolved sugar.</p> 

<p>• \ 5 goblet nearly to the brim with shaved</p> 

<p>into it all the Bourbon whiskey the goblet will</p> 

<p>* Take a few sprigs of mint leaves and use for</p> 

<p>decorating the top of the mixture, after it has been well</p> 

<p>frapped with a spoon. Then drink it. But," warned</p> 

<p>Marse Henry, "do not use a straw, son."</p> 

<p>I know that this was Marse Henry's version of a real</p> 

<p>Kentucky mint julep, for I was the young—and thirsty</p> 

<p>—newspaper reporter.</p>

<p>1 teaspoon powdered sugar</p>

<p>sprigs of tender mint shoots</p> 

<p>Use the goblet in which the julep is to be served. Place some of</p> 

<p>j '"'"'if''®® f bottom, with the sugar and a litde water,</p> 

<p>and muddle or bruise the leaves. Add the cognac and peach</p> 

<p>brandy. Fill ^e goblet with finely crushed ice. Jiggle with the</p> 

<p>long-handled barspoon until well frapped.</p> 

<p>Jiggling is not stirring. Stirring calls for a rotary</p> 

<p>motion, but "jiggling" is dashing the spoon up and down</p> 

<p>st^eadily until the outside of the goblet is frosted. Place</p> 

<p>the metal or glass container on atable to do your jiggling</p> 

<p>—do not hold the glass for heat of the hand will hinder</p> 

<p>frost from forming on the outside. When the julep has</p> 

<p>Thirty</p> 

<p>been thoroughly jiggled, thrust in a bunch of the ten-</p> 

<p>derest mint shoots arranged to simulate a bouquet.</p> 

<p>This julep is to be absorbed with a straw, a short one</p> 

<p>so that the drinker's nose is buried in the very heart</p> 

<p>of the green nosegay as he drinks, thus adding the de</p> 

<p>light of aroma to the delight of taste.</p> 

<p>San Domingo Julep</p> 

<p>1 piece of loaf sugar</p> 

<p>l'/2 jigger rum</p> 

<p>sprigs of mint</p> 

<p>Into a tall glass (preferably a metal goblet) drop the sugar and</p> 

<p>moisten with a Uttle water. Take several mint leaves and crush</p> 

<p>while the sugar is being muddled with the barspoon. Fill with</p> 

<p>shaved or finely crushed ice. Pour in the rum. Jiggle to frappe</p> 

<p>the mixture. Set a bouquet of mint leaves on top before serving.</p> 

<p>Aslice of orange peel for garnish is ritzy but not strictly necessary.</p> 

<p>This seems to be the original mint julep that came</p> 

<p>to Louisiana away back in 1793, at the time the white</p> 

<p>aristocrats, who were expelled from San Domingo by</p> 

<p>the uprising of the blacks, settled in New Orleans. In</p> 

<p>the United States, especially those states south of the</p> 

<p>Mason and Dixon line, Bourbon whiskey gradually took</p> 

<p>the place of sugar cane rum as the spirit of the drink.</p> 

<p>Many advocate the use of both red whiskey and rum</p> 

<p>in making a julep, but if you wish to quaff the original</p> 

<p>San Domingo julep use rum alone. Any of the well-</p> 

<p>known imported or domestic brands will do, such as</p> 

<p>Bacardi, Cabildo, Carioca, Pontalba, Rumrico, Charles</p> 

<p>ton, Don Q., Puerto Rico, Jamaica, St. Croix, Red Heart,</p> 

<p>or Pilgrim.</p> 

<p>Thirty-one</p> 

<p>Brandy Mint Julep</p> 

<p>1 spoon powdered sugar</p> 

<p>1 pony Bourbon whiskey</p> 

<p>1 pony peach brandy</p> 

<p>sprigs of mint leaves</p> 

<p>Mix as directed for the juleps in preceding pages. Use plenty of</p> 

<p>crushed ice and frappe with the long-handled barspoon.</p> 

<p>It is rank heresy even to mention it, but some Georgia</p> 

<p>julep experts make theirs by substituting Bourbon whis</p> 

<p>key for cognac brandy. Whichever you use, Bourbon</p> 

<p>or brandy, remember that quicker and prettier frosting</p> 

<p>will result if you use a silver or other metal goblet rather</p> 

<p>than glass. The outside of the container must be kept</p> 

<p>dry if it is to take on a good frost, so do not hold it in</p> 

<p>your hand when jiggling.</p> 

<p>Sf. Regis Mint Julep</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon water</p> 

<p>1 dozen mint leaves</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>14 pony rum</p> 

<p>1 dash grenadine sirup</p> 

<p>Into a tall glass crush the mint leaves with a barspoon. Dissolve</p> 

<p>die sugar in water and stir. Pour in the whiskey and rum, then</p> 

<p>the grenadine sirup. Fill the glass with crushed ice and jiggle</p> 

<p>with the spoon. When properly frapped decorate the top with</p> 

<p>sprigs of mint.</p> 

<p>This recipe departs in two ways from the usual . . .</p> 

<p>the use of rye for Bourbon and the introduction of grena</p> 

<p>dine sirup. In spite of its straying from the neither</p> 

<p>straight nor narrow path of Bourbon, this julep is ex</p> 

<p>ceedingly good on a hot day, or any day, for that matter.</p> 

<p>It is the julep that is served at the St. Regis Restaurant</p> 

<p>bar and is the pride of head-bartender John Swago.</p> 

<p>Thirty-two</p> 

<p>Louisiana Mini-Julep</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon powdered sugar</p> 

<p>jigger Bourbon whiskey</p> 

<p>sprigs of mint</p> 

<p>crushed ice</p> 

<p>Put a dozen leaves of mint in a barglass, cover with powdered</p> 

<p>sugar and just enough water to dissolve the sugar. Crush sugar</p> 

<p>and mint leaves gently with a muddler or barspoon. Pour half</p> 

<p>the mint and sugar liquid in the bottom of the tall glass in which</p> 

<p>the julep is to be served. Then enough shaved or snowball ice</p> 

<p>to half fill. Next add the remaining mint and sugar liquid,</p> 

<p>fill nearly to the top with shaved ice. Pour, in the Bourbon</p> 

<p>until the glass is full to the brim. Place in the refrigerator at</p> 

<p>least an hour before serving to acquire ripeness and frost. Top</p> 

<p>with mint sprigs.</p> 

<p>Time was when the mint julep was strictly a symbol</p> 

<p>of the South—a green and silver emblem of Dixie's</p> 

<p>friendly leisure. But today the mint julep, that most</p> 

<p>glorious of summer drinks, is becoming as popular above</p> 

<p>the Mason and Dixon line as below it.</p> 

<p>Some term the Louisiana julep the last word in per</p> 

<p>fection, so if you have the feeling you haven't sampled a</p> 

<p>real julep, try the above. If you are still in doubt and</p> 

<p>are willing to go to some trouble, try the one below.</p> 

<p>New Orleans Mint Julep</p> 

<p>Put the glasses or the metal goblets in the refrigerator</p> 

<p>the night before you are to serve juleps. This is a high-</p> 

<p>powered julep so you'll need two jiggers of Bourbon</p> 

<p>for every glass. In the serving glass drop a layer of</p> 

<p>mint leaves, fill one-quarter full with shaved or snow</p> 

<p>ball ice, then one teaspoon of powdered sugar. Repeat</p> 

<p>until the glass is half ibll. Add one jigger of Bourbon.</p> 

<p>Repeat until the glass is full, the second jigger of Bour</p> 

<p>bon being the last to go into the glass. Serve on a</p> 

<p>tray with a straw or tube in each goblet so that hand</p> 

<p>does not touch the container, which is frosted white.</p>

<p>bitter wormwood taste." Sha\espeare's Lucrece. 1593.</p> 

<p>Absinthe Drinks</p> 

<p>According to some authorities, absinthe as a drink</p> 

<p>originated in Algeria, and French soldiers serving in</p> 

<p>the Frango-Algerian war (1830-47) introduced the green</p> 

<p>spirits to Paris upon their return from the North African</p> 

<p>country where the drink foimd strong favor along the</p> 

<p>boulevards. . In time the spectacle of bearded men and</p> 

<p>demi-mondes dripping their absinthes became one of</p> 

<p>the sights of Paris. Naturally, so fashionable a Parisian</p> 

<p>drink was not long in finding its way to the Little Paris</p> 

<p>of North America—New Orleans.</p> 

<p>The drink, which was spelled absynthe in New Or</p> 

<p>leans liquor advertisements in 1837, when it was appar</p> 

<p>ently first imported from France and Switzerland, was</p> 

<p>a liquor distilled from a large number of various</p> 

<p>herbs, roots, seeds, leaves, and barks steeped in anise. It</p> 

<p>also included Artemisia ashinthium, a herb known as</p> 

<p>"Wormwood' abroad, but called Herbe Sainte by the</p> 

<p>French-speaking population of Louisiana. In recent years</p> 

<p>wormwood has been condemned as harmful and habit-</p> 

<p>forming, and laws have been enacted forbidding its use</p> 

<p>in liquors in the United States and other countries. In</p> 

<p>addition to banning wormwood from manufactured</p> 

<p>liquor, the use of the word "absinthe" on bottles of</p> 

<p>modern concoctions which do not contain wormwood,</p> 

<p>is also banned. As a consequence, manufacturers of ab</p> 

<p>sinthe substitutes have been forced to adopt trade names.</p> 

<p>Thirty-four</p> 

<p>Old Absinthe House</p> 

<p>Of all the ancient buildings in New Orleans' famed</p> 

<p>Vieux Carr6, none has been more glorified in story and</p> 

<p>picture than a square, plastered-brick building at the</p> 

<p>corner of Bourbon and Bienville streets, known as "The</p> 

<p>Old Absinthe House."</p> 

<p>Hoary legend has long set forth that the building was</p> 

<p>erected in 1752, 1774, 1786, 1792, but as a matter of fact</p> 

<p>it was actually built in 1806 for the importing and com</p> 

<p>mission firm of Juncadella & Font, Catalonians from</p> 

<p>Barcelona, Spain. In 1820, after Francisco Juncadella</p> 

<p>died and Pedro Font returned to his native land, the</p> 

<p>place continued as a commission house for the barter of</p> 

<p>foodstuffs, tobacco, shoes, clothing, as well as liquids</p> 

<p>in bulk from Spain, and was conducted by relatives of</p> 

<p>the builders. Later it became an epicerie, or grocery</p> 

<p>shop; for several years it was a cordonnerie, or boot and</p> 

<p>shoe store, and not until 1846 did the ground floor corner</p> 

<p>room become a coffee-house, as saloons were then called.</p> 

<p>This initial liquid-refreshment establishment was run</p> 

<p>by Jacinto Aleix, a nephew of Senora Juncadella, and</p> 

<p>was known as "Aleix's Coffee-House." In 1869, Caye-</p> 

<p>tano Ferrer, a Catalan from Barcelona, who had been</p> 

<p>a bar-keeper at the French Opera House, transferred his</p> 

<p>talents to the old Juncadella casa and became principal</p> 

<p>drink-mixer for the Aleix brothers. In 1874, Cayetano</p> 

<p>himself leased the place, calling it the "Absinthe Room"</p> 

<p>T hirty-five</p> 

<p>because of the potent dripped absinthe he served in the</p> 

<p>Parisian manner. His drink became so popular that it</p> 

<p>won fame not only for Cayetano, but for the balance</p> 

<p>of his family as well—papa, mamma, Uncle Leon, and</p> 

<p>three sons, Felix, Paul, and Jacinto, who helped to attend</p> 

<p>the wants of all and sundry who crowded the place.</p> 

<p>What the customers came for chiefly was the emerald</p> 

<p>liquor into which, tiny drop by tiny drop, fell water from</p> 

<p>the-brass faucets of the pair of fountains that decorated</p> 

<p>the long cypress bar. These old fountains, relics of a</p> 

<p>romantic past, remained in the Casa ]uncadella for many</p> 

<p>years. Came prohibition when the doors of "The Old</p> 

<p>Absinthe House" were padlocked by a United States mar</p> 

<p>shal, and the contents of the place went under the ham</p> 

<p>mer. Pierre Cazebonne purchased the prized antiques,</p> 

<p>together with the old bar, and set them up in another</p> 

<p>liquid refreshment parlor a block farther down Bourbon</p> 

<p>street, where signs now inform the tourist that therein</p> 

<p>is to be found the original "Old Absinthe Bar' and anti</p> 

<p>que fountains, and we find the marble bases pitted from</p> 

<p>the water which fell, drop by drop, from the faucets over</p> 

<p>the many years they served their glorious mission.</p> 

<p>In these modern years the tourist yearning for an old</p> 

<p>flavor of the Old New Orleans to carry back as a memory</p> 

<p>of his visit, goes to 400 Bourbon street, not only to see</p> 

<p>the venerable fountains and bar, but to be served absinthe</p> 

<p>frappe by a son of Cayetano Ferrer, the Spaniard who</p> 

<p>established "The Old Absinthe House." Jacinto Ferrer</p> 

<p>(we who know him call him "Josh") should indeed</p> 

<p>know how to prepare the drink properly for he has been</p> 

<p>at it 65 years. Josh served his apprenticeship in his</p> 

<p>father's celebrated "Absinthe Room" in W2, and today</p> 

<p>at three-score-years-and-ten, carries on with an air the</p> 

<p>profession at which he began his apprenticeship as a five-</p> 

<p>year-old boy.</p>

<p>glass which has a small hole in the bottom (use a strainer if you</p> 

<p>haven't the glass) and allow water to drip, drop by drop, slovvly</p> 

<p>into the sugar. When the desired color which indicates its</p> 

<p>strength has been reached and most of the sugar dissolved, stir</p> 

<p>with a spoon to frapp(f. Strain into a serving glass.</p> 

<p>This recipe is for the original dripped absinthe that</p> 

<p>made famous Cayetano Ferrer's "Old Absinthe House</p> 

<p>when he introduced the Parisian drink to New Orleans</p> 

<p>—the drink containing oil of wormwood which instigat</p> 

<p>ed the banishing of the word "Absinthe" ftoi^ bottle</p> 

<p>labels. It is the same dripped absinthe, the "Fairy with</p> 

<p>Green Eyes," described in Marie Corelli's famous book</p> 

<p>"Wormwood."</p> 

<p>Today, the absinthe substitutes are free of the hari^ul</p> 

<p>extract of the herb Artemisia absinthium, and entirely</p> 

<p>safe when imbibed (in moderation) at any bar.</p> 

<p>Absinthe Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 jigger absinthe substitute</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon sugar sirup</p> 

<p>1 dash anisette</p> 

<p>2 dashes Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>2 ounces charged water</p> 

<p>Fill a highball glass a little more than half full wiA cracked or</p> 

<p>crushed ice. Pour in the absinthe substitute, sugar sirup, anisette,</p> 

<p>and bitters, then squirt in carbonated or other live water. ^Jiggle</p> 

<p>with a barspoon until the mixture is well frapp^d. Strain into</p>

<p>Absinthe Frappe</p> 

<p>1 jigger absinthe substitute</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon sugar sirup</p> 

<p>1 jigger charged water</p> 

<p>Fill a small highball glass with cracked or shaved ice. Pour in</p> 

<p>the sugar sirup, then the absinthe substitute, and drip water</p> 

<p>(seltzer or other charged water will improve it) slowly while</p> 

<p>frappeing with the spoon. Continue jiggling the barspoon until</p> 

<p>the glass becomes well frosted.</p> 

<p>This is the simple and easy way to prepare an absinthe</p> 

<p>drink, one that has many devotees in many lands. Of</p> 

<p>course, if you have a shiny cocktail shaker and want to</p> 

<p>put it to work, you can use it. Shake until the shaker</p> 

<p>takes on a good coating of frost, and then pour the mix</p> 

<p>ture into glasses which have been well iced before the</p> 

<p>drink is prepared.</p> 

<p>Absinthe Anisette</p> 

<p>1 pony anisette</p> 

<p>1 jigger absinthe substitute</p> 

<p>Use a small glass and fill with shaved or finely cracked ice. Pour</p> 

<p>in the anisette and absinthe. Jiggle with a barspoon until heavily</p> 

<p>frapped and serve in the same glass. A straw goes with this one.</p> 

<p>The modern absinthe substitutes cannot be detected in</p> 

<p>taste even by those who were familiar with the original</p> 

<p>but now illegal liquor, a flood of fancy and trademarked</p> 

<p>names has resulted, and it is marketed under such names</p> 

<p>as Greenopal, Herbsaint, Pernod, Assent, Milky Way,</p> 

<p>and the like.</p>

<p>14 pony anisette or ojen</p> 

<p>1 dash orange bitters</p> 

<p>2 dashes Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>Put the absinthe substitute and dry gin in a shaker. Add anisette</p> 

<p>or ojen (make your own choice), and the two bitters. Fill shaker</p> 

<p>with crushed ice to frappe.</p> 

<p>This is a special cocktail featured by Solari's, manu</p> 

<p>facturers of Greenopal, the absinthe substitute that gives</p> 

<p>this cocktail its foundation. The name green opal comes</p> 

<p>from its lovely opalescent color.</p>

<p>1/3 jigger French vermouth</p> 

<p>Pour all ingredients into a barglass filled with ice. Jiggle with</p> 

<p>a barspoon until well frapped, and serve in a cold cocktail glass.</p> 

<p>This is a Spanish cocktail featured by Fernandez 8e Co.,</p> 

<p>famous Ojen distillers of Jerez, Spain. Barkeepers who</p> 

<p>claim that Ojen should not be mixed with other liquors,</p> 

<p>say this one ought to give anybody the "jitters."</p> 

<p>Old and odd names for Ojen in New Orleans were</p> 

<p>"Majorca" and "Anis del mono" Majorca for the fam</p> 

<p>ous Spanish island in the Mediterranean, and Anis del</p> 

<p>mono meaning "monkey anise." Why monkey.? Your</p> 

<p>guess is as good as mine. Maybe enough Ojen cocktails</p> 

<p>encourage monkeyshines!</p>

<p>Ojen</p> 

<p>1 jigger ojen</p> 

<p>1 glass crushed ice</p> 

<p>1 ctince carbonated water</p> 

<p>Fill a barglass with crushed ice. Add a jigger of ojen. Jiggle</p> 

<p>energetically with a barspoon for a moment or two. Add an</p> 

<p>ounce of seltzer or other charged water and jiggle again. Strain</p> 

<p>into a cocktail glass which has been thoroughly chilled.</p> 

<p>Ojen possesses so much delicacy of flavor that it should</p> 

<p>be served neat and not mixed with other ingredients, al</p> 

<p>though there are recipes that call for mixing. While an</p> 

<p>Ojen is supposed to be frapp^d with a spoon, a good</p> 

<p>shaking will do no harm to the flavor and will induce a</p> 

<p>thicker coating of frost.</p> 

<p>Ojen (which is pronounced oh-hen) is a word short</p> 

<p>ened from the Spanish ajenjo {ah-hen'ho) meaning ab</p> 

<p>sinthe and wormwood in the musical tongue of Spain. It</p> 

<p>is manufactured from anise, which is also a predominant</p> 

<p>ingredient in absinthe, and despite its original Spanish</p> 

<p>name, Ojen contains no harmful wormwood.</p> 

<p>Ojen Cocktail</p> 

<p>1 jigger ojen</p> 

<p>2-3 dashes Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>seltzer water.</p> 

<p>Stir the mixture in a barglass with ice, add a little seltzer or other</p> 

<p>charged water, and strain into a frapped cocktail glass.</p> 

<p>The bitters give this Ojen a delicate rose-colored tinge.</p> 

<p>Therefore it masquerades under the name of "Pink</p> 

<p>Shimmy," or pinque chemise, if you prefer the language</p> 

<p>of the fifty million who can't be wrong.</p>

<p>Mix the sugar with charged water, vermouth, and absinthe. Drop</p> 

<p>in the white of egg. Fill the glass with cracked ice and shake</p> 

<p>vigorously. Strain into a champagne glass in which there is a</p> 

<p>cherry with crime de menthe poured over it.</p> 

<p>Suissesse, a perfectly good French word meaning a</p> 

<p>Switzerland-born female, lives up to the reputation</p> 

<p>earned by those hardy daughters dwelling among the</p> 

<p>rocks of their picturesque land. The Alps are wonder</p> 

<p>ful—so is a Suissesse. If the name stumps you, pronounce</p> 

<p>it "swee-cess" and you'll make the barkeep understand</p> 

<p>what you want. If you yearn to mix one yourself, fol</p> 

<p>low the directions given above and find out why some</p> 

<p>folk call a Suissesse tops in mixed drinks.</p> 

<p>Green Opal Suissesse</p> 

<p>The Suissesse given above is probably what originated</p>

<p>"The Infamous Liquor, the name of tvhich deriv'd from</p> 

<p>Juniper-Berries in Dutch, is now, by frequent use from a word</p> 

<p>of midling length shrun\ into a Monosyllable, Intoxicating Gin."</p> 

<p>Gin Drinks</p> 

<p>Of all popular alcoholics, gin probably leads in favor,</p> 

<p>especially in tropic and sub-tropic countries. To go high</p> 

<p>bat Avitb the language, gin is an aromatized potable with</p> 

<p>a characteristic flavor derived from the juniper berry.</p> 

<p>The word "gin" is merely a shortening of the liquor's</p> 

<p>original name, geneva, taken from an old Dutch word,</p> 

<p>genever, a name for the juniper berry.</p> 

<p>In old writings (such as one of 1706: "Geneva, a kinde</p> 

<p>of Strong Water, so called") are found many references</p> 

<p>to this liquor. Its shortened form Gin, formerly denoted</p> 

<p>a double distilled spirit of British manufacture, imitation</p> 

<p>of the original liquor, marketed by the Dutch as Hollands</p> 

<p>geneve, later known as Hollands, but today called Hol</p> 

<p>land Gin.</p> 

<p>That the British form of geneve was for many years</p> 

<p>even as now a popular drink, is amply proved by litera</p> 

<p>ture of the past. For example, in 1709 "The Gypsie</p> 

<p>With Flip and Geneve got most Damnably Typsie," and</p> 

<p>in 1728, Dean Swift, driving home a simile, wrote: "Their</p> 

<p>chatt'ring makes a louder din than fishwives o'er a cup</p> 

<p>of jin."</p> 

<p>Our so-called dry gin, usually coupled with the infor</p> 

<p>mation on the bottle that it is "London Dry Gin," as</p> 

<p>popular in this country and the British possessions, as it</p> 

<p>is in the Merry Old Isle. First made in England by a</p> 

<p>redistillation process repeated frequently before bottling,</p> 

<p>it is quite different from the old Holland gins which</p> 

<p>verge on the sweet side.</p> 

<p>Forty-two</p> 

<p>Fable tells us that the name "Old Tom" Gin, of certain</p> 

<p>British brands, was so named when an old Tom cat fell</p> 

<p>into a barrel of the spirits. This tradition is antedated</p> 

<p>by the fact that years before the tale of the drowned cat</p> 

<p>went the rounds, Hodge's Distillery in England named</p> 

<p>their brand of gin for old Tom Chamberlain, a distiller</p> 

<p>employed by them. His picture in the garb of a sailor</p> 

<p>appears on the labels pasted on the bottles.</p> 

<p>Sloe Gin, used in some of our fancy mixed drinks, is</p> 

<p>named for a small, bitter black wild plum, the oil of</p> 

<p>which is used to flavor the distilled spirit—^not because</p> 

<p>there is anything slow about its effects. Sloe gin is fast</p> 

<p>coming into favor because of its mild strength and the</p> 

<p>distinctive flavor given it by the sloe berries—tart yet</p> 

<p>somewhat sweet.</p> 

<p>Practically all of the gin drinks, the drys. Old Toms,</p> 

<p>and sloes, belong in the tall glass category . . . tall ones</p> 

<p>that tinkle when filledwith iceand makehot days coolish</p> 

<p>and hot nights cooler. Before you try any of the famous</p> 

<p>New Orleans recipes which have for their basic ingredient</p> 

<p>good old gin, first let me introduce you to a mixed drink</p> 

<p>that has won world-wide acclaim—New Orleans own</p> 

<p>and truly refreshing Ramos Gin Fizz.</p> 

<p>1,1]:; vnc-|h'</p>

<p>v.if ' hi-,' ;</p> 

<p>•1' 'J.</p> 

<p>Forty-three</p> 

<p>Ramos Gin Fizz</p> 

<p>1 tablespoon powdered sugar</p> 

<p>3-4 drops orange flower water</p> 

<p>Vz lime—juice only</p> 

<p>Vz lemon—^juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger dry gin</p> 

<p>1 white of egg</p> 

<p>1 jigger rich milk or cream</p> 

<p>1 squirt seltzer water</p> 

<p>2 drops extract vanilla (optional)</p> 

<p>Mix in a tall barglass in the order given; add crushed ice, not</p> 

<p>too fine as lumps are needed to whip up the froth of the egg white</p> 

<p>and cream. Use a long metal shaker and remember this is one</p> 

<p>drink which needs a long, steady shaking. Keep at it until the</p> 

<p>mixture gets body—"ropy" as some experienced barkeepers ex</p> 

<p>press it. When thoroughly shaken, strain into a tall thin glass for</p> 

<p>serving.</p> 

<p>This gin fizz long has been an institution in the city</p> 

<p>care forgot. The age of the Ramos gin fizz is well past</p> 

<p>the half-century mark and its popularity shows no signs</p> 

<p>of abating. In the good old days before the federal gov</p> 

<p>ernment was so prodigal with padlocks, the saloons of</p> 

<p>Henry C. Ramos were famous for the gin fizzes shaken</p> 

<p>up by a busy bevy of shaker boys. Visitors, not to men</p> 

<p>tion home folk, flocked in droves to the Ramos dis</p> 

<p>pensary to down the frothy draft that Ramos alone knew</p> 

<p>how to make to perfection. One poetical sipper eulo</p> 

<p>gized it thus: "It's like drinking a flower!"</p> 

<p>Exactly what went into the making of a Ramos gin</p> 

<p>fizz always has been more or less a secret. One thing is</p> 

<p>certain—only at the Ramos establishment could one get</p> 

<p>what tasted like a real gin fizz. Wherefore, like all suc</p> 

<p>cessful drinks, the Ramos fizz was widely imitated but</p> 

<p>never really duplicated. Possibly no other thirst assuag-</p> 

<p>Forty-four</p> 

<p>ing emporium gave the mixture the long deliberate shak</p> 

<p>ing it received from the shaker boys behind the Ramos</p> 

<p>bar, and that was the secret of its lip-smacking goodness.</p> 

<p>Came prohibition, and the drink that made the name of</p> 

<p>Ramos famous disappeared. After the return of legal</p> 

<p>liquor the trade name of Ramos on a gin fizz was ac</p> 

<p>quired by the Hotel Roosevelt, and today that is its legal</p> 

<p>domicile.</p> 

<p>The gin fizz, and by that I mean the common or gar</p> 

<p>den variety, had its beginning way back yonder, but the</p> 

<p>Ramos concoction was not known to Orleanians until</p> 

<p>1888 when Henry C. Ramos came to New Orleans from</p> 

<p>Baton Rouge and purchased the Imperial Cabinet saloon</p> 

<p>from Emile Sunier. The Cabinet was located at the</p> 

<p>corner of Gravier and Carondelet streets (where a</p> 

<p>modern Sazerac saloon now holds forth) and above it,</p> 

<p>on the second story, was a famous restaurant of days</p> 

<p>gone by—The Old Hickory. Here it was that Henry</p> 

<p>Ramos served the gin fizz that departed so radically from</p> 

<p>the other frothy gin mixtures served in New Orleans</p> 

<p>saloons, and here he remained until 1907 when he pur</p> 

<p>chased Tom Anderson's Sta^r saloon opposite the Gravier</p> 

<p>street entrance to the St. Charles Hotel.</p> 

<p>The new place became a mecca for the thirsty and for</p> 

<p>those pioneers who would make a pilgrimage of any sort</p> 

<p>for a new drink. At times The Stag became so crowded</p> 

<p>that customers were forced to wait an hour or more (or</p> 

<p>soitseemed)tobeserved. Thecorpsofbusyshakerboys</p> 

<p>behind the bar was one of the sights of the town during</p> 

<p>Carnival, and in the 1915 Mardi Gras, 35 shaker boys</p> 

<p>nearly shook their arms off, but were still unable to keep</p> 

<p>Up with the demand.</p> 

<p>Forty-five</p> 

<p>The recipe given is the original formula. Veteran bar-</p> 

<p>keeps differ violently—practically come to blows—over</p> 

<p>the inclusion of the two innocent drops of extract of</p> 

<p>vanilla. Old-timers who worked for Henry Ramos in</p> 

<p>the past declare the original Ramos included no vanilla</p> 

<p>in its make-up. Others hold that the twin drops of ex</p> 

<p>tract wrung from the heart of the vanilla bean either</p> 

<p>make or break a real gin fizz—make it taste like heaven</p> 

<p>or the reverse.</p> 

<p>Therefore, when you mix your fizz, add the two vanil</p> 

<p>la drops or leave them out, just as you please. If still in</p> 

<p>doubt, take it up with Paul Alpuente at the Hotel Roose</p> 

<p>velt bar. He was with Henry Ramos for years and when</p> 

<p>he mixes your Ramos gin fizz, watch him closely.</p> 

<p>Tom Collins</p> 

<p>1 barspoon powdered sugar</p> 

<p>1 lemon—juice only</p> 

<p>1 dash orange flower water</p> 

<p>V2 lime—juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger dry gin</p> 

<p>2 ounces seltzer water</p> 

<p>Into a tall highball glass place a generous spoonful of bar sugar.</p> 

<p>Squeeze in the juice of a lemon. Add a dash of orange flower</p> 

<p>water, and squirt in about 2 ounces of seltzer. Stir until the</p> 

<p>sugar is dissolved. Next squeeze in the juice of half a lime and</p> 

<p>add a generous jigger of gin. Stir. Add several lumps of fine</p> 

<p>ice and jiggle with a barspoon. Add just enough seltzer to fill</p> 

<p>to the brim and jiggle energetically. Serve in the mixing glass.</p> 

<p>Who was Tom Collins? No matter—especially on a</p> 

<p>hot summer day.when you need the coolest, the most re</p> 

<p>freshing drink known to sweltering humanity. Whether</p> 

<p>or not you know anything about Mr. Collins or his an</p> 

<p>tecedents, or why he was important enough to have a</p> 

<p>forty^</p> 

<p>drink named for him, you can take otu: word for it that</p> 

<p>this one is among the best known and best liked drinks</p> 

<p>in New Orleans, and all points West, East, and North.</p> 

<p>Like many another thirst-quencher, the Tom Collins is</p> 

<p>subject to infinite variations. It is not difficult to con</p> 

<p>coct and no knack is needed to make it just right, but</p> 

<p>we implore you not to leave out the dash of orange flow</p> 

<p>er water. Depart not from the recipe above, sanctioned by</p> 

<p>John Swago, one of the best old-time mixologists who</p> 

<p>ever pushed a Tom Collins across polished mahogany.</p> 

<p>Then there is Rum Collins, or "Charley Collins",</p> 

<p>which found its way into New Orleans from Cuba. To</p> 

<p>make this one substitute Cuban type rum, Bacardi or</p> 

<p>like brands, for the dry gin, but don't leave out the dash</p> 

<p>of orange flower water.</p> 

<p>John Collins</p> 

<p>1 barspoon powdered sugar</p> 

<p>1 lemon—juice only</p> 

<p>1 dash orange flower water</p> 

<p>'/2 lime—^juice only</p> 

<p>3-4 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>V* jigger rum</p> 

<p>2 ounces seltzer water</p> 

<p>A John Collins is made exactly like the Tom Collins</p> 

<p>with one exception . . . use no gin. The same amount of</p> 

<p>sugar, lemon, orange flower water, lime and seltzer. Sub</p> 

<p>stitute for the gin three-quarters of a jigger of rye</p> 

<p>whiskey plus one-quarter jigger rum. Mix, stir, and ice</p> 

<p>in the same way you fixed up Brother Tom, and there</p> 

<p>you have a cooling summer drink, preferred by many to</p> 

<p>the one named for Tom Collins.</p> 

<p>Forty-seven</p> 

<p>Gin Fizzes</p> 

<p>Silver, Golden, and Royal Fizzes</p> 

<p>1 lemon—juice only</p> 

<p>1 barspoon powdered sugar</p> 

<p>1 jigger dry gin</p> 

<p>seltzer water</p> 

<p>Mix in a bar glass, drop in several lumps of ice, cover with a</p> 

<p>shaker and shake well. Pour into a tall serving glass and fill</p> 

<p>with seltzer water.</p> 

<p>The above is the common or garden variety of gin fizz,</p> 

<p>in \vhich that old standby gin plays the principal role,</p> 

<p>and is not to be confused w^ith the celebrated Ramos gin</p> 

<p>fizz that has helped contribute to New Orleans' fame.</p> 

<p>As with other popular drinks, the gin fizz lends itself</p> 

<p>to endless variations. We have the Silver Fizz, the Golden</p> 

<p>Fizz, and the Royal Fizz—a trinity of throat-ticklers in</p> 

<p>which the addition of an egg, in its separate and col</p> 

<p>lective parts, makes the difference.</p> 

<p>A Silver Fizz is made exactly like the gin fizz given</p> 

<p>above—with the addition of the white of an egg. Shake</p> 

<p>well in a shaker, remembering that largish pieces of ice</p> 

<p>are needed whenever any part of an egg is added to a</p> 

<p>mixture.</p> 

<p>A Golden Fizz is identical with the ahove, save that the</p> 

<p>yolk only of the egg is used.</p> 

<p>A Royal Fizz requires both the yolk and white of the</p> 

<p>egg-</p> 

<p>In any of these gin fizzes it must be remembered that</p> 

<p>the fizz water is added to the drink after it has been</p> 

<p>shaken and strained into the serving glass.</p> 

<p>Forty-eight</p> 

<p>Dry Martini</p> 

<p>1 pony French vermouth</p> 

<p>1 pony dry gin</p> 

<p>J4 teaspoon orange bitters</p> 

<p>Mix in a barglass with several good sized lumps of ice and stir</p> 

<p>with a barspoon—never put a dry martini in a shaker, as William</p> 

<p>Powell and Myrna Loy did in The Thin Man. Be sure to use</p> 

<p>French brut or dry vermouth if you want your cocktail to crackle.</p> 

<p>Don't forget the olive! A small pearl onion may take its place</p> 

<p>if you're onion-minded. Spear the olive (or onion) with a tooth</p> 

<p>pick for dainty transfer from hand to mouth.</p> 

<p>Visitors who know their liquor will soon discover that</p> 

<p>in no other one city does the man behind the bar mix</p> 

<p>a better dry martini than in New Orleans. That is be</p> 

<p>cause the bartender makes a simple operation of it, using</p> 

<p>the better French makes of dry vermouth, such as Noilly</p> 

<p>Prat, Cinzano, and Cazapra; and dry gins like Gordon's,</p> 

<p>Hiram Walker's, Gilbey's, Milshire's, Fleischmann's, Sil</p> 

<p>ver Wedding, or similar brands. When making your</p> 

<p>own, use a good make of orange bitters. Do not shake.</p> 

<p>We repeat—do not sha\e, even if you heard us the first</p> 

<p>time. Stir, and serve in a chilled glass.</p> 

<p>The dry martini was originally called the "Waldorf-</p> 

<p>Astoria cocktail" as it was first made of French vermouth</p> 

<p>(not the sweeter Italian brand) at that famous old New</p> 

<p>York hostelry in the gay '90's. The recipe called for a</p> 

<p>dash of orange bitters, 1/3 French vermouth, and 2/3 dry</p> 

<p>gin . . . olive, of course.</p> 

<p>John Swago, of the St. Regis, who knows what he is</p> 

<p>about when concocting a dry martini, uses dry gin and</p> 

<p>French vermouth in equal portions, and not the 2/3 gin</p> 

<p>and 1/3 vermouth usually suggested in drink recipes.</p> 

<p>Drink one of John's dry martinis and taste the difference!</p>

<h3>Not-Too-Dry Martini </h3> 
<br>
<p>	 1-2 dashes orange bitters</p> 
<p>	 2/3 French vermouth</p> 
<p>	 1/6 Italian vermouth</p> 
<p>	 1/6 dry gin</p> 
<br>
<p>This one is for those who prefer their martini cocktail </p> 
<p>not too dry and not too sweet. Stir as directed in </p> 
<p>the dry recipe withseveral pieces of ice. </p> 
<p>Strain into serving glass on top of an olive.</p> 
<p>Note that this martini is darker in color</p>
<p>and a trifle on the sweet side.</p> 
<p>This one is frequently termed "the perfect martini."</p> 
<br>

<h3>Sweet Martini</h3> 

<br>
<p>	1 part dry gin</p> 
<p>	2 parts Italian vermouth</p> 
<br>

<p>This is the one to mix if a sweet martini is what you want. Stir</p> 
<p>and serve as directed for the dry martini, but do not include an</p> 
<p>olive when you strain it into the cocktail glass.</p> 
<p>The Italian vermouths are not as dry as those made in</p> 
<p>France and are classified as "sweet" vermouths. A fav-</p> 
<p>orite Italian vermouth is that manufactured by Martini</p> 
<p>& Rossi, which vermouth, by the way, gave this cocktail</p> 
<p>its name. Vermout is the French word applied to a liquor</p> 
<p>manufactured from white wine flavored with certain</p> 
<p>aromatic herbs. In this country we spell it vermouth.</p>

<h3>Wallis Blue Cocktail</h3> 

<br>

<p>1 pony Cointreau</p> 
<p>1 jigger dry gin</p> 
<p>1 lime juice only</p> 

<br>

<p>Mix in a shaker well supplied with pieces of ice. Shake. Strain</p> 
<p>into a cocktail glass, the rim of which should be rubbed with</p> 
<p>the lime pulp and dipped in sugar just before being filled and</p> 
<p>served.</p> 
<br>
<p>When radio and newspapers blazoned to the world</p> 
<p>that the Duke of Windsor had concocted a new cocktail</p> 
<p>at Chdteau de Cande, Monts, France, in honor of his</p> 
<p>marriage to the Lady from Baltimore, many recipes</p> 
<p>purporting to be THE one found their way into print—</p> 
<p>most of them impossible.</p> 
<br>
<p>The former Edward VIII of England toasted his duch-</p> 
<p>ess-to-be in what proves to be a variation of the well-</p> 
<p>known and popular "Side Car" cocktail, with gin sub-</p> 
<p>stituted for brandy. That the cocktail might match the</p> 
<p>eyes of his American bride and reflect her penchant for</p> 
<p>blue, vegetable dye was added to give the proper color.</p> 
<p>Truly a royal gesture.</p> 
<br>
<p>The king who surrendered a throne for the woman he</p> 
<p>loved, mixed a delightful and well-balanced cocktail.</p> 
<p>You can do the same, if Cointreau is used. While there</p> 
<p>are a number of satisfactory domestic cordials of the dis-</p> 
<p>tilled orange type, it is better to stick to the imported</p> 
<p>brand of M. Cointreau, of Angers, France. Do not sub-</p> 
<p>stitute lemon juice for lime, and be sure you use a good</p> 
<p>brand of dry gin. The blue coloring matter isn't abso-</p> 
<p>lutely necessary—but it looks pretty and matches Wally's</p> 
<p>eyes.</p>

<h3>Side Car Cocktail</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 jigger cognac brandy</p> 
<p>1 pony Cointreau</p> 
<p>1 lime juice only</p> 
<br>

<p>Pour into a mixing glass with cracked ice and shake well. 
<p>Strain</p> 
<p>from the shaker into a cocktail glass, chilled before serving. The</p> 
<p>imported French Cointreau will he found superior to domestic</p> 
<p>brands.</p> 
<br>
<p>This is the Cointreau drink upon which the Duke of</p> 
<p>Windsor based the "Wallis Blue" cocktail he created at</p> 
<p>the prenuptial dinner for his bride.</p> 

<p>Some prefer lemon when making a Side Car to the</p> 
<p>tangy flavor of lime. Others make it by using one-third</p> 
<p>each of brandy, curao, and lemon juice. Some substi-</p> 
<p>tute Triple Sec for the Cointreau. All are mighty good.</p> 
<p>One thing to bear in mind when mixing and serving the</p> 
<p>Side Car is that it must be well frapped. Therefore, never</p> 
<p>use cocktail glasses that have not been well chilled in</p> 
<p>advance.</p> 
<br>
<p>Legend has it that this cocktail was created by accident.</p> 
<p>An innkeeper of France, confused and excited by news</p> 
<p>of damage to his side car, combined separate orders of</p> 
<p>cognac brandy, Cointreau, and lemon juice into a single</p> 
<p>drink. The mischance proved a bonanza, for the happy</p> 
<p>mixture found instant favor. Growing in popularity</p> 
<p>through the years. Side Car has now become the smart</p> 
<p>drink of two continents.</p>

<h3>Vieux Carre Cocktail</h3> 
<br>
<p>54 teaspoon benedictine</p> 
<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters</p> 
<p>1 dash Angostura bitters</p> 
<p>1/3 jigger rye whiskey</p> 
<p>1/3 jigger cognac brandy</p> 
<p>1/3 jigger Italian vermouth</p> 
<br>
<p>The benedictine is used as a base and also for sweetening the</p> 
<p>cocktail. Dash on the bitters, then add the rye,</p> 
<p>vermouth. Put several lumps of ice in the barglass. Stir with</p> 
<p>a slice of lemon peel over the mixture. Drop an apple slice </p> 
<p>and a cherry if you wish and serve in mixing glass.</p> 
<br>
<p>This is the cocktail that Walter Bergeron, head bar-</p> 
<p>tender of the Hotel Monteleone cocktail lounge, talks</p> 
<p>special pride in mixing. He originated it, he says, to do</p> 
<p>honor to the famed Vieux Carre, that part of New Or-</p> 
<p>leans where the antique shops and the iron lace balconies</p> 
<p>give sightseers aglimpse into the romance of another day.</p> 

<br>

<h3>Orange Blossom</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 pony orange juice</p> 
<p>2 ponies dry gin</p> 
<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters</p> 
<br>
<p>This drink calls for a shaker. Allow plenty of ice</p> 
<p>sure the mixture is well frapp^d before pounng into cocktail</p> 
<p>glasses previously chilled.</p> 
<br>
<p>A simple drink to mix and simply grand to drink,</p> 
<p>especially on a hot day or a warm night. Some, devotees </p> 
<p>of this cocktail prefer a half-and-half mixture of</p> 
<p>orange juice, and some forego the delight of the dash of </p> 
<p>Peychaud bitters in favor of the addition of ahttle grena-</p> 
<p>dine sirup or a little honey. Some make it by using a </p> 
<p>third each of gin, Italian vermouth, and orange juice.</p> 
<br>
<p>Whichever recipe you follow, be sure you have a sweet</p> 
<p>juicy orange. We recommend Louisiana Sweet the best</p> 
<p>on the market.</p>

<h3>Rickeys</h3>
<br>
<p>1 jigger dry gin</p> 
<p>or </p> 
<p>sloe gin,</p> 
<p>rum,</p> 
<p>rye whiskey,</p> 
<p>bourbon whiskey</p> 
<br>
<p>1/2 lime—^juice and pulp</p> 
<p>seltzer water</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix in the 6 or 8 ounce highball glass in which it is to be </p> 
<p>served. Fill with crushed ice and squirt on the seltzer or other</p> 
<p>sparkling water. Remember the lime pulp is left in the glass.</p> 
<br>
<p>Rickeys must have lime juice in their composition,</p> 
<p>whether they are made with dry or sloe gin, Cuban type</p> 
<p>rum, rye or Bourbon whiskey. Use plenty of ice cubes</p> 
<p>when mixing, don't fail to include the squeezed-out lime</p> 
<p>pulp, and liven with seltzer water. Any of the waters</p> 
<p>which do queer things to your nose will answer.</p>
<br> 
<p>All we know about the naming of this simple, satisfy-</p> 
<p>ing summer drink which comes to us in a tall glass with</p> 
<p>clinking ice, is that it was named for a certain Colonel</p> 
<p>Joseph Rickey. Another allegation is that he was a</p>

<p>1 jigger unsweetened pineapple juice</p> 
<p>1 lemon—juice only</p>

<p>1 white of egg</p>

<br>
<p>sugar with the gin and pineapple juice imtil dissolved. Add</p> 
<p>juice of the lemon and lime. After placing in shaker with plenty</p> 
<p>of ice lumps, add the white of egg—remembering that one egg</p> 
<p>will do for a dozen portions. Shake vigorously, as with all </p> 
<p>drinks containing egg white. Serve in clear crystal glasses. This </p> 
<p>drink IS as pleasant to the eye as to the palate with its pale </p> 
<p>amber color collar of foam.</p>

<p>brought the original recipe back from Mexico imder the</p>

<h3>Bronx Cocktail </h3>
<br>

<p>4 dry girr French dry vermouth</p>
<p>14 Italian vermouth </p> 	
<p>1 thick slice orange </p>	
<p>1 dash Peychaud </p>

<br>

<p>It is bitter sweet. As the flavor depends upon the orange, </p> 
<p> it would be to select a Louisiana Sweet, if possible.</p> 
<p>The tall barglass should be filled with shaved ice and,</p>
<p> with the metal shaker over it, given a vigorous</p> 
<p> shaking before contents are strained into the serving</p> 
<p>glass. Some add a dash of Peychaud or Angostura bitters to the</p> 
<p>mixture before serving.</p> 
<br>
<p>Just why this particular mixture was christened the</p> 
<p>Bronx remains a mystery and probably always will. It is</p> 
<p>quite possible some inspired soul concluded that if Man-</p> 
<p>hattan had its own particular cocktail there was no good</p> 
<p>reason why the Borough of the Bronx should not simi-</p> 
<p>larly be honored.</p> 
<br>
<p>Like the Manhattan, there are a number of favored</p> 
<p>recipes for the Bronx, varying in the quantities of gin,</p> 
<p>vermouths, and orange used. The recipe given above is</p> 
<p>the one usually served in New Orleans, and when a Lou-</p> 
<p>isiana Sweet orange is used, the stranger in on nudst</p> 
<p>learns that a Louisiana-grown Valencia is much juicier</p> 
<p>and sweeter than the oranges which come to us from</p> 
<p>Florida or sunny California. (Florida and California-</p> 
<p>papers please copy.)</p>

<h3>Old Hickory Cocktail</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 pony French vermouth</p> 
<p>1 pony Italian vermouth</p> 
<p>1 dash orange bitters</p> 
<p>2 dashes Peychaud bitters</p> 

<br>

<p>Pour the two vermouths into a barglass, add the dash of orange</p> 
<p>bitters, the two shots of Peychaud hitters. Fill with cubes of ice</p> 
<p>and stir well. Strain into a serving glass. Twist a piece of </p> 
<p>lemon peel over then drop it into the glass.</p> 
<br>
<p>According to hoary but unsubstantiated tradition, this</p> 
<p>was the favorite tipple of General Andrew Jackson when</p> 
<p>he was in New Orleans the winter of 1814-15 helping</p> 
<p>Lafitte win the Battle of New Orleans.</p> 
<br>
<p>But we can promise this Old Hickory cocktail won't</p> 
<p>be as tough on your palate as was "Old Hickory" Jackson</p> 
<p>on the British that historic Eighth of January.</p> 
<br>
<h3>Pink Lody</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 pony dry gin</p> 

<p>I pony applejack or apple brandy</p> 

<p>1 lime juice only</p> 

<p>2 barspoons grenadine syrup</p> 

<p>1 white of egg</p> 
<br>
<p>Use a barglass for mixing. The amount of grenadine used will</p> 

<p>determine the sweetness of the drink as well as the pinkness of</p> 

<p>Me lady. The white of egg, which will do for one or a dozen</p> 

<p>drinks, improves its smoothness. Use large lumps of ice in the</p> 

<p>shaker. Serve in chilled cocktail glasses.</p> 
<br>
<p>ladies and ladies, but this one, named for a</p> 

<p>light opera, makes everything rosy.</p> 

<p>Another with plenty of championing boy friends is</p> 

<p>concocted thus: two barspoons of grenadine or raspberry</p> 

<p>grup, a jigger of gin, white of egg, and three dashes of</p> 

<p>Peychaud bitters. Prepare in a shaker glass and exercise</p> 

<p>your arms, for this one is "To the Ladies!"</p>

<h3>Clover Club</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 jigger diy gin</p> 

<p>VI lime—juice only</p> 

<p>1 pony raspberry sirup</p> 

<p>1 white of egg</p> 

<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters.</p> 
<br>
<p>Pour the ingredients into the shaker in order given. Drop in</p> 

<p>the lumps of ice. Set yourself for a good shaking, for this is a cock-</p> 

<p>tail that must be well frapped To give chic to the final result,</p> 

<p>decorate your cocktail glasses with sprigs of mint after straining</p> 

<p>into them the delightful liquid from your shaker.</p> 

<p>Some of the how-to-mix'em experts use grenadine syrup</p> 

<p>instead of the raspberry. Upon experiment it will be</p> 

<p>found that red raspberry not only gives a prettier pink</p> 

<p>color but imparts a flavor grenadine cannot match. As it</p> 

<p>has the white of an egg in it, this cocktail must be well</p> 

<p>shaken.</p> 
<br>

<p>Why was it named a coyer cocktail? Well, you have</p> 

<p>us there. Possibly it's because the lucky recipient, after</p> 

<p>tossing it off (or should this drink be tossed?) will con-</p> 

<p>cede that the finding of a four-leaf clover is not so lucky</p> 

<p>as finding this cocktail.</p> 

<br>

<p>We have always admired the added ummph the dash</p> 

<p>of Peychaud bitters gives this deservedly popular concoction</p>

<h3>Alexandre</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 pony dry gin</p> 

<p>1 pony creme de cacao</p> 

<p>1 pony rich cream</p> 

<p>1 white of egg</p> 
<br>
<p>Have just enough shaved or finely pounded ice in the shaker</p> 

<p>before pouring in the gin, creme de cacao, and cream. Remember</p> 

<p>that one white of egg will do, whether you are mixing for two</p> 

<p>or a dozen guests. Be strenuous in your shaking whenever there</p> 

<p>is white of egg or cream in a mixture. Shake, brother, sl^c,</p> 

<p>and then shake some more for good measure. Strain into cocktail</p> 

<p>glasses and hear your guests call you a good mixer.</p>
<br> 

<p>Smooth as cream, delicate as dew, and easily prepared</p> 

<p>is the Alexandre. Some who mix this particular cocktail</p> 

<p>do not use the white of egg. A mistake, for the albumen</p> 

<p>gives a froth and an added smoothness which makes this</p> 

<p>cocktail different. Like all drinks in which egg white is</p> 

<p>used vigorous shaking is required. Give the Alexandre</p> 

<p>all you've got in elbow grease to make it live up to its</p> 

<p>reputation for it is truly Alexander the Great among</p> 

<p>drinks in its class.</p> 
<br>
<p>Note our Frenchy spelling. If you have trouble with</p> 

<p>its pronunciation, simply hold your nose tight between</p> 

<p>thumb and forefinger. But, should you by mischance</p> 

<p>pronounce it Alexander , it will taste just be the same.</p> 

<p> And the taste is simply de-lovely.</p>

<p>"The chiefe judling they make in the Islands Barbados is Rum</p> 

<p>bullion, alias Kill-Devil, and this is made of sugar canes </p> 

<p>distilled, a hott, hellish, and terrible Liquor." </p> 

<p>1651 Rum Drinks</p> 
<br>
<p>From time immemorial rum has been distilled as a by</p> 

<p>product of the manufacture of sugar in all countries</p> 

<p>where sugar cane is grown. As a liquor it became the ac-</p> 

<p>cepted beverage practically everywhere that strong drink</p> 

<p>was in demand, and with the spread of its popularity all</p> 

<p>lusty liquors, regardless of origin, were termed "rum."</p> 

<p>In the early days blackstrap molasses, from which rum</p> 

<p>was distilled, was shipped from Jamaica, Puerto Rico,</p> 

<p>Santo Domingo, Cuba, and the Barbados into staid New</p> 

<p>England. True rum is a spirit distilled from "dunder"</p> 

<p>and molasses.</p>
<br>
<p>Dunder is from the Spanish word</p> 

<p>redundar, meaning overflow, and applied to the lees or</p> 

<p>dregs of cane juice used in the fermentation of rum. The</p> 

<p>word "rum" is an abbreviation of rumbullion, meaning</p> 

<p>tumult or up roar, and its not an inappropriate application!</p> 

<p>North American Indians had their own name for the</p> 

<p>drink—they called it "cootv tvootv," a sort of improve-</p> 

<p>ment on their customary war whoop.</p> 

<p>Remember the ditty sung by the pirate crew in Robert</p> 

<p>Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island?</p> 
<br>
<p>"Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!"</p> 
<br>
<p>Cuba holds the palm for producing the best rum, al</p> 

<p>though staid old New England has made excellent rum</p> 

<p>from imported blackstrap molasses since 1680, and Lou-</p> 

<p>isiana's sugar plantations today contribute their share of</p> 

<p>excellent domestic brands. More than a century ago</p> 

<p>Louisiana's rum masqueraded under the name of tafia.</p> 

<p>There's naught, nodoubt, so much thespirit calms as rum and</p> 

<p>true religion." Lard Byron's Don Juan, 1819.</p>

<h3>Bacardi Cocktail</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 

<p>1 lime—juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger rum Bacardi</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix in a barglass. Muddle the sugar and Ume jiucc thoroughly</p> 

<p>before adding the rum. Fill with cracked ice. Shake well and</p> 

<p>then strain into a cocktail glass.</p> 
<br>
<p>You and I may argue a lot and get nowhere regarding</p> 

<p>the proper pronunciation of the word Bacardi, but after</p> 

<p>sampling this cocktail, there'll be no argument as to its</p> 

<p>effect and authority. It is by far the best way to sewe</p> 

<p>sugar cane rum, whether bottled in New England, Cuba,</p> 

<p>Jamaica, Puerto Rico, or Louisiana.</p> 
<br>
<p>In making a Bacardi cocktail be sure to use lime, not</p> 

<p>lemon, and put no grenadine or other flavored syrup into</p> 

<p>the mixture. When you shake a Bacardi, frapp it long</p> 

<p>and well, for it must be served very cold to get the de-</p> 

<p>licious flavor of the rumbullion.</p> 
<br>
<p>Bacardi rum received its name from the Bacardi family</p>   

<p>of Cuba, well-known distillers and bottlers at Santiago of</p> 

<p>this particular brand. The correct pronunciation is ha-</p> 

<p>car-di.</p> 
<br>

<h3>Daiquiri Cocktail</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 teaspoon grenadine syrup</p> 

<p>1 lime juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger rum</p> 
<br>
<p>Like the Bacardi, the Daiquiri should be well shaken; </p> 

<p>lime juice, not lemon, should be used to furnish the tang. The</p> 

<p>grenadine sweetens the cocktail and gives it color. Shake well</p> 

<p>with ice and strain into the serving glass.</p> 
<br>
<p>The Daiquiri, like the Bacardi, is a Cuban importation</p> 

<p>and is very popular m Havana as well as New Orleans.</p>

<br>
<div>
    <footer>
    <b>Sixty</b> 
    <footer>
</div>
<br>

<p>Again like the Bacardi its name is truly Cuban, Daiquiri</p> 

<p>being the name of a city in the southeastern part of that</p> 

<p>famous island not very far from Santiago.</p> 

<p>The two cocktails are quite similar, the difference ly-</p> 

<p>ing in the inclusion or omission of the grenadine sirup.</p> 

<p>Both are good. Daiquiri is pronounced "Dach-er-ree.</p> 

<br>
<h3>Frozen Daiquiri</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 lime juice only</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 

<p>1 dash white maraschino liqueur</p> 

<p>1 jigger rum</p> 
<br>
<p>Place the lime juice and sugar in an electric mixing cup, dash</p> 

<p>on the white maraschino liqueur, and add the rum. Fill half</p> 

<p>full of finely crushed ice (shaved ice won't do) and place cup</p> 

<p>under the electric mixer. Let it run until the mixture is well</p> 

<p>frapped . . . until it is practically a sherbet. Strain in a saucer-</p> 

<p>shaped champagne glass using an ordinary kitchen wire</p> 

<p> strainer. Shake from side to side and tap rim of the strainer </p> 

<p>with spoon to force the fine icy particles through the mesh.</p> 

<p>During the good old summertime a new sort of cock</p> 

<p>tail, with rum for its basis, has taken New Orleans by</p> 

<p>storm—a sort of snow storm. If you have not met the</p> 

<p>Frozen Daiquiri just picture a champagne glass filled</p> 

<p>with snow, cold as Christmas, and as hard as the heart of</p> 

<p>a traffic cop.</p> 
<br>

<p>You'll have to have something beside the old reliable</p> 

<p>cocktail shaker to produce this one. It must be whirred to</p> 

<p>its icy smoothness with an electric drink mixer the kind</p> 

<p>used in making a malted milk.</p> 
<br>
<p>It is also called "West Indies Cocktail."</p>

<h3>Cuban Presidente </h3> 
<br>
<p>1/2 jigger rum</p> 

<p>1/2 jigger French dry vermouth</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon grenadine syrup</p> 

<p>curacao</p> 

<p>curagao</p> 

<br>

<p>Rum first in the harglass, then the vermouth, Curasao</p> 

<p>, and syrup. Put in the ice. Stir (never shake). After </p> 

<p>straining into the serving glass, add a piece of orange peel.</p> 

<p>This is the drink to toast the Cuban presidente (who</p> 

<p>ever he may be at the present moment). A heady salute</p> 

<p>for a nation's head. It might be mentioned that some</p> 

<p>prefer their presidente with grenadine only and without</p> 

<p>the Curasao.</p> 

<br> 


<h3>New Orleans Presidente</h3> 

<br>

<p>1 tablespoon grenadine syrup</p> 

<p>1 jigger rum</p> 

<p>1 tablespoon orange juice</p> 

<br>

<p>Shake with ice, lots of it cracked fine, and strain into a cocktail</p> 

<p>glass.</p> 

<br>

<h3>American Presidente</h3> 
<br>

<p>1 pony rum </p> 

<p>1 pony French dry vermouth "</p> 

<p>1 lemon juice only </p> 

<p>1 dash curagao</p> 

<p>1 dash grenadine sirup</p> 
<br>

<p>Proceed as with the Cuban presidente and drop a maraschino</p> 

<p>cherry into the cocktail glass before straining the mixture into</p> 

<br>

<p>it. Today several brands of rum, made from Louisiana</p> 

<p>sugar cane molasses, are finding favor . . . even among</p> 

<p>those who have long believed that rum, to be good, must</p> 

<p>come from Cuba, Jamaica, or Puerto Rico.</p>

<h3>Grog</h3> 
<br>

<p>2 ponies rum</p> 

<p>water</p> 

<p>ice</p> 
<br>
<p>Pour the rum into an 8-ounce tumbler, add ice, and fill to the</p> 

<p>brim with water. Stir. Drink.</p> 

<br>

<p>In the old days in Louisiana, especially in that section</p> 

<p>settled by the British, Irish, and Scottish pioneers. The</p> 

<p>tipple in high favor was called "grog." It was made of</p> 

<p>the locally distilled tafia or rum, and was dispensed by</p> 

<p>the British plantation owners of the Feliciana district as</p> 

<p>a cheap yet potent beverage to slaves who worked the</p> 

<p>cotton fields. Many references to the drink are to be</p> 

<p>found in tattered documents written during the days of</p> 

<p>the Spanish domination. It was set down in them as</p> 

<p>"mezcla de argmrdicnte con agua."</p> 

<br>
<p>In 1753 the French of New Orleans knew rum as a</p> 

<p>drogue (a cheap or sorry commodity) and, while it was</p> 

<p>known as tafia, it was also called guildive (divine fer</p> 

<p>mentation), and eau de vie sucre, meaning "sugar</p> 

<p>brandy".</p> 
<br>
<p>The name "Grog" was derived from "grogram, a</p> 

<p>material of rough texture, ordinarily of camel's wool,</p> 

<p>used in the making of cloaks. The designation came</p> 

<p>about in this way: In 1740 Admiral Edward Vernon</p> 

<p>liberally diluted with water the rum he served the sailors</p> 

<p>aboard his frigate. It was the admiral's custom to wear a</p> 

<p>grogram cloak in foul weather, and for this reason the</p> 

<p>tars called him "Old Grog" behind his back. Forth with</p> 

<p>his tars derisively termed the weakened drink "grog,"</p> 

<p>and the name has stuck through the centuries, as witness</p> 

<p>"grog shop," likewise "groggy," indicating the unsteady</p> 

<p>gait that follows a too-liberd sampling of spirits.</p>

<h3>Planter's Punch</h3> 
<br>
<p>2 lumps of sugar</p> 

<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters</p> 

<p>1 lime juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger water</p> 

<p>2 jiggers rum</p> 

<br>
<p>The Planter's Punch calls for a tall glass. Squeeze the lime juice</p> 

<p>on the sugar. Add the bitters, water, the two full jiggers of rum;</p> 

<p>fill the glass with shaved or crushed ice. Frapped well with</p> 

<p>a long handled barspoon. Sift a little nutmeg on top</p> 

<p> or a dash of red pepper if you don't mind the bite.</p> 

<p>The southern planter had something there! </p>

<br>

<p>If this man-sized drink were indeed part of a planter's life on</p> 

<p>a Southern plantation, there was more to his routine than</p> 

<p>cotton bolls, sugar cane, slaves, and offspring. As we have</p> 

<p>all along contended, good old sugar cane molasses rum</p> 

<p>was the planter's stand-by, notwithstanding traditional</p> 

<p>tales of the huge consumption of Monongahela red</p> 

<p>whiskey.</p> 



<h3>Jamaican Planters' Punch</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 part lime juice</p> 

<p>2 parts sugar</p> 

<p>3 parts Jamaica rum</p> 

<p>1/3 parts water and ice</p> 
<br>
<p>A doggerel for this recipe runs: "One of sour, two of</p> 

<p>sweet, three of strong, and four of weak," thus making</p> 

<p>it easy to keep the proportions in mind. This is Planters'</p> 

<p>Punch as it is made in Kingston, Jamaica, British West</p> 

<p>Indies, where the rum is manufactured. For the regula-</p> 

<p>tion Planters' Punch a dash of Peychaud bitters must be</p> 

<p>added. Shake and serve very cold.</p>

<h3>Mississippi Planter's Punch</h3>
<br>
<p>1 tablespoon sugar</p> 

<p>1 lemon juice only</p> 

<p>1/2 jigger rum</p> 

<p>h3 jigger Bourbon whiskey</p> 

<p>1 jigger cognac brandy</p> 
<br>

<p>Dissolve the sugar with a little water in a mixing glass. Add</p> 

<p>the lemon juice, then the rum, Bourbon, and brandy. Fill with </p> 

<p>fine ice, clap on the shaker, and go to work. When well frapped </p> 

<p>pour into a long thin glass. Decorate with fruit </p> 

<p>(if you want to be swanky) and serve with a straw.</p> 
<br>
<p>If this cooler doesn't make a Mississippi cotton planter</p> 

<p>forget about the boll weevil, charbon, and high water,</p> 

<p>give up trying to make him forget. All that is lacking</p> 

<p>in the recipe is a shady gallery, a rocking chair, and a</p> 

<p>palmetto fan.</p> 
<br>

<h3>Tangipohoo Planter's Punch</h3>
<br>

<p>1/3 pineapple juice</p> 

<p>1/3 orange juice</p> 

<p>1/3 lime or lemon juice</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon grenadine sirup</p> 

<p>2 jiggers rum</p> 

<br>
<p>After mixing and sweetening to taste with the grenadine,</p> 

<p> add the fruit juice, the two jiggers of rum, and put </p> 

<p>plenty of ice in the tall glass. Jiggle with the barspoon</p> 

<p> until well frapped. "Aw, nertz!" said a friend of mine </p> 

<p>who likes to furnish his inner man with </p> 

<p>certain powerful potables several times a day,  </p>

<p>"the dope you wrote on the opposite page</p> 

<p>ain't a Planter's Punch! Leastwise," he hedged, "it ain't</p> 

<p>what we folks up in Tangipahoa call a Planter's Punch.</p> 

<br>

<p>As a result of this criticism I cajoled from him the</p> 

<p>above recipe. Ever notice how all recipes for Planter's</p> 

<p>punches call for two jiggers, and never one, of rum?</p> 

<p>That, you'll agree, is a redeeming feature. So don't be</p> 

<p>thrifty with the oh-be-joyful when you concoct a punch</p> 

<p>by this or any other recipe.</p>

<h3>Viva Villa</h3> 
<br>

<p>1 lime—juice and pulp</p> 

<p>1 table-spoon of sugar</p> 

<p>1 generous jigger tequila</p> 
<br>

<p>Dissolve sugar in a little water. Squeeze on the juice of a green</p> 

<p>lime and drop in the pulp of half the lime. Next the jigger of</p> 

<p>tequila and fill to the brim with finely cracked ice. Jiggle with</p> 

<p>the spoon until well frapped. A pinch of salt brings on the </p> 

<p>flavor. Tequila is a native Mexican liquor distilled from the</p> 

<p>Century plant, which also supplies the Mexicanos with</p> 

<p>mescal, another powerful potable. The drink gets its</p> 

<p>name from the Tequila district where the Century plants</p> 

<p>(Agave tequilana) are cultivated for the fermented juices</p> 

<p>they yield. Tequila is practically colorless—but don't let</p> 

<p>that fool you.</p> 

<br>

<p>All you need to make this drink perfect is a sombrero</p> 

<p>and a senorita. Omit the sombrero if necessary, but don't</p> 

<p>leave out the senorita!</p>

<h3>Rum Runner</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 jigger rum</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 

<p>2 ponies pineapple juice (unsweetened)</p> 

<p>1 lime—juice only</p> 

<p>1 dash Peychaud bitters</p> 
<br>

<p>Dissolve the sugar in the unsweetened pineapple juice. Squeeze</p> 

<p>in the juice of a lime (lemon will answer but it doesn't give </p> 

<p> quite the flavor a lime does). Then the bitters and muddle well.</p> 

<p>The jigger of rum is added. You may stir this drink with several</p> 

<p>lumps of ice but shaking improves it and the white of an egg</p> 

<p>gives it added smoothness.</p> 
<br>

<p>During the unlucky thirteen years that Prohibition</p> 

<p>darkened the land, the rum runner was the only little</p> 

<p>ray of sunshine on an otherwise sombre horizon.</p>

<h3>Jean Laffite Cocktail</h3>

<p>1 jigger rum</p> 

<p>1 egg yolk</p>

<p>and others of their ilk was a noggin or two, or three, of a</p> 

<p>distinctive and potent beverage called le petit goyave,</p> 

<p>brewed from the fermented juice of the fruit of the</p> 

<p>aguava or century plant and toting the kick of an army</p> 

<p>mule. In Mexico the same liquor is called pulque. It was</p> 

<p>served at the CafS des RifugUs in Saint Philippe street,</p> 

<p>a tavern where was ever assembled a motley crew of</p> 

<p>swiggers—colons de Saint-Domingue, West Indian sea</p> 

<p>men, revolutionnaires, filibusters, and </p> 

<p>Kentucky flatboat-men.</p> 
<br>
<p>Host Jean Baptiste Thiot mixed another curious drink</p> 

<p>which he called "The Pig and Whistle." Years later, in</p> 

<p>1835, when Thiot deserted the St. Philip street location</p> 

<p>and opened a new eating and drinking tavern in Old</p> 

<p>Levee (Decatur) street opposite the French Market, he</p> 

<p>called the new tavern after his famed mixed drink—"The</p> 

<p>Pig & Whistle."</p>

<p>"She ordered coffee, and afterwards chasse-cafe." 1800.</p> 

<br> 

<b>Pousse Cafe</b> 

<br>
<p>There are two schools of thought regarding the naming</p> 

<p>and spelling of a Pousse Cafe but only one regarding</p> 

<p>its goodness. Properly made it becomes a drink with</p> 

<p>more rings than an old-fashioned Barnum & Bailey circus.</p> 

<p>Here we have a post-prandial drink made of layers</p> 

<p>of variously colored cordials—the heaviest poured first</p> 

<p>into the serving glass and the following layers gently and</p> 

<p>skillfully achieved one ring at a time with the aid of a</p> 

<p>spoon. The lightest liqueur, usually cognac, is poured on</p> 

<p>last.</p> 
<br>

<p>The name Pousse cafe is said to have been derived from</p> 

<p>chasse cafe, literally "chase coffee" or a "coffee chaser," a</p> 

<p>potion of liquor taken after a meal ostensibly to remove</p> 

<p>the taste of coffee, tobacco, or what have you. The term,</p> 

<p>usually shortened to chasse, was applied as a rule to</p> 

<p>brandy, crime de menthe, or like cordials, but in time</p> 

<p>became definitely attached to the ringed drink of various</p> 

<p>cordials, now known as Pousse cafe.</p> 
<br>

<p>For another (and probably more authentic) version:</p> 

<p>pouce, French for "inch" or "thumb," indicates that in</p> 

<p>the early days of the original concocting of the drink, an</p> 

<p>inch or pouce of red sirup was first poured in the glass;</p> 

<p>then a pouce of Curasao, then a pouce of chartreuse, and</p> 

<p>so on to the final pouce of brandy that topped it. Thus it</p> 

<p>became a pouce cafi or "inch" drink, until finally the</p> 

<p>word pouce was corrupted into pousse, a French word</p> 

<p>with an entirely different meaning.</p> 
<br>

<p>"So one glass of cognac neat, as a chasse (to more things than</p> 

<p>claret)." 1857.</p>

<p>1/6 topaz cognac brandy</p> 

<br>

<p>Care and skill are essential in the making. Use a short, trans</p> 

<p>parent round glass and put in each cordial separately, also very,</p> 

<p>very slowly so as to eliminate blending. The heaviest of the</p> 

<p>syrups is poured in first to form the bottom ring. Ease in with</p> 

<p>a spoon, so that the liquid will not fall with force enough to</p> 

<p>mix with the preceding ring. The last or top ring is of cognac.</p> 

<p>When completed the drink will be composed of six different </p> 

<p>rings, each complete in itself. Lovely! '</p>

<br>

<p>This is the drink that was vogue in New Orleans in</p> 

<p>1852 when Joseph Santini opened his "The Jewel of the</p> 

<p>South" saloon in Gravier street opposite the side entrance</p> 

<p>of the old and fashionable Saint Charles Hotel. It is said</p>

<p>try his hand on this one before experimenting with the</p>

<h3>Cuban Rainbow Pousse Cafe</h3> 
<br>

<p>1/8 grenadine syrup</p>

<p>1/8 green chartreuse</p> 

<p>1/8 Cuban rum</p> 
<br>
<p>The preparation of this pousse Cafe is the same as given in the</p> 

<p>recipes. Note, however, that this rainbow of liqueurs calls for a</p> 

<p>ring of rum to top it (brandy may be substituted). Set a fire </p> 

<p>with a match and the rainbow will be a blaze of color.</p> 
<br>
<p>This is the Pousse cafe that Sloppy Joe of Havana,</p>

<p>1 jigger Cuban type rum</p> 
<br>
<p>Ginger beer is not to be had these days, but ginger ale will do</p> 

<p>as well. Mix with ice.</p> 
<br>
<p>Guzzle is a somewhat inelegant word meaning to</p> 

<p>drink immoderately or frequently. Prior to the Civil</p> 

<p>War days the Iron Horse tavern was famed for its</p> 

<p>guzzle. As it increased in popularity along a certain</p> 

<p>New Orleans street it acquired the name of that street</p> 

<p>and became known as the Tchoupitoulas Street Guzzle.</p> 

<p>Tchoupitoulas (pronounced Chop-a-too'-las) was the</p> 

<p>name of an ancient Indian tribe that had its village in</p> 

<p>what is now the upper part of New Orleans. Just what</p>

<p><i>"Buy any brand-wine, buy any brand-wine?" </i></p> 
<br>
<p><i>London street cry, 1622</i></p> 
<br>

<b>Brandy Drinks</b> 

<p>The name brandy comes from Old Dutch Brandy,</p> 

<p>meaning "burnt (i.e. distilled) wine," and to the end of</p> 

<p>the 17th century the old original form, "brandy-wine"</p> 

<p>was used. Properly, brandy is an ardent spirit distilled</p> 

<p>from wine, although similar liquors distilled from fer-</p> 

<p>mented juice of peaches, cherries, apples, or other fruits,</p> 

<p>are also called brandies . . . such as peach brandy.</p> 
<br>
<p>Genuine cognac is recognized as the finest of brandies</p> 

<p>and was called cognac from the fact that a superior</p> 

<p>brandy is produced at or near the town of Cognac in the</p> 

<p>Charente region of France, center of a famous grape</p> 

<p>growing territory. For the same reason brandy is better</p> 

<p>known today as cognac in its native land than by its ori-</p> 

<p>ginal French name of eau-de-vie. In the United States it</p> 

<p>is usually called "cognac brandy."</p> 
<br>
<p>While the term cognac is loosely applied to any French</p> 

<p>brandy, it should be borne in mind that all brandy is</p> 

<p>not cognac. Among the better known cognacs are those</p> 

<p>of Martell, established in 1715, and that produced by the</p> 

<p>firm of James Hennessy, whose bottles carry the familiar</p> 

<p>"three-star" designation. In 1765 the original James Hen-</p> 

<p>nessy, an Irish adventurer, offered his sword in service</p> 

<p>to the French king, and during his fighting days was</p> 

<p>stationed in the Charente valley where he became en</p> 

<p>amored of the excellent brandy there produced. When</p> 

<p>swords were sheathed, Hennessy settled in this vineyard</p> 

<p>country and became a grape-grower, a brandy-distiller,</p> 

<p>and a cognac-bottler.</p>

<b>Cafe Royale</b> 
<br>
<p>In New Orleans a certain coffee drink is often errone-</p> 

<p>ously called a pousse cafe. It is in reality a Cafe Royale</p> 

<p>or Cafe Real, nothing more or less than black coffee</p> 

<p>in a demi tasse with cognac brandy floated on top.</p> 
<br>
<p>It should not be called a chasse cafe because basically</p> 

<p>it is coffee itself, and you can't chase coffee with coffee.</p> 

<p>The Cafe Royale should not be confused with that other</p> 

<p>famous New Orleans' after-dinner drink, Cafe Brulot,</p> 

<p>the recipe for which will be found on the next page.</p> 
<br>

<h3>Orange Brulof</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 orange</p> 

<p>1 fony cognac brandy</p> 

<p>1 lump sugar</p> 
<br>
<p>Take an orange and lightly slit the peel horizontally</p> 

<p>through the middle, then turn the rind back and upward</p> 

<p>to form a cup. Repeat with the other half of rind, re-</p> 

<p>versing the process to form a base. Be careful </p> 

<p>not to disengage the peel from either end of the </p> 

<p>orange, and leave the stripped orange pulp intact </p> 

<p>for the center standard of your natural goblet.</p> 

<p>In the upper part of the orange rind or cup place a</p> 

<p>lump of sugar, then pour in the pony of brandy. Set off</p> 

<p>with a match and stir while the sugar is dissolving in the</p> 

<p>blue flame.</p> 

<p>Preparing this natural container takes practice and</p> 

<p>deftness, and the idea of burning the brandy in the</p> 

<p>orange rind is for the sake of the flavor and oil contained</p> 

<p>in the peel, besides making a picture that charms with its</p> 

<p>novelty. "The fruit of the orange is delightful to eat after</p> 

<p>the brandy has been burned and the drink quaffed.</p>

<h3>Cafe Brulot </h3> 
<br>
<p>1 cup cognac brandy </p> 

<p>45 pieces loaf sugar</p> 

<p>50 whole cloves</p> 

<p>3 pieces stick cinnamon broken in bits</p> 

<p>54 orange peel cut thin</p> 

<p>1 small piece lemon peel cut thin</p> 

<p>1 quart strong New Orleans dripped coffee</p> 
<br>
<p>Combine the ingredients in advance. In a bowl, pour a cup</p> 

<p>(54 pint) of cognac brandy. Add the sugar, cloves, stick of cin-</p> 

<p>namon broken in bits, thinly cut orange peel, and sliced lemon</p> 

<p>rind. The mixture should be set to steep for at least six hours</p> 

<p>in advance of serving time to allow the brandy, spices, </p> 

<p>and citrus oils to blend. The coffee is prepared separately </p> 
<p>and is not mixed with the spiced brandy</p>
<p>until serving time. Will serve 20 guests.</p> 
<br>

<p>A special brulot equipment is required if you are to</p> 

<p>burn cafe brulot successfvally. This equipment consists of</p> 

<p>a specially manufactured bowl of silver on copper, a cir-</p> 

<p>cular tray, and a long-handled ladle, all of the same metal</p> 

<p>known as Sheffield. Don't use your wife's silver fruit</p> 

<p>dish, even though it may resemble a brulot bowl in shape</p> 

<p>and appearance. </p> 
<br>
<p>We know a man who did this in the ab-</p> 

<p>sence of the little woman, and rich old Aunt Hattie's</p> 

<p>wedding gift phi^ted into the shape of Aunt Hattie in</p> 

<p>fewer minutes than it takes to tell. We hesitate to speak</p> 

<p>of the fiery aftermath when the storm-and-strife returned.</p> 

<p>Put the brandy mixture in the bowl, then pour a small</p> 

<p>portion of alcohol into the circular tray, just enough to</p> 

<p>sparingly cover the base of the bowl. The dripped coffee,</p> 

<p>prepared in advance, is brought to the table steaming</p> 
<p>hot.</p>
<br>

<p>All lights in the room are extinguished to accent the</p> 

<p>brulot flames; the alcohol in the tray is touched off with</p> 

<p>a match and allowed to burn until the contents of the</p> 

<p>bowl are heated. Dip up a little of the mixture with the</p> 

<p>ladle and hold in the flame rising from the tray, then</p> 

<p>dip ladle in the mixture to hurry the process of ignition.</p> 


<br>

<br> 

<p>Stir, lifting the ladle high in the air. A ribbon of golden-</p> 

<p>blue flame follows the motion, and is a sight to goggle</p> 

<p>the eyes of the uninitiate. Allow to burn only a few</p> 

<p>moments as too much bturning uses up the alcoholic con-</p> 

<p>tent. Pour in the coffee, slowly and lovingly.</p> 

<p>Serve in after-dinner coffee cups. This recipe makes</p> 

<p>enough to thrill 20 coffee connoisseurs.</p> 

<p>Do not attempt to make brMot with ordinary coffee.</p> 

<p>Boiled or percolator coffee will not answer. What is</p> 

<p>known as French or New Orleans dripped coffee must</p> 

<p>be used and made very strong. Most New Orleans folk</p> 

<p>prefer chicory in their coffee; which gives a richer color</p> 

<p>and heavier flavor. Therefore,for brulot use a coffee-and-</p> 

<p>chicory brand, such as Luzianne, Union, Chase and San-</p> 

<p>born Louisiana Roast, French Market, Morning Joy, etc.</p> 

<p>Put coffee in upper receptacle of a drip coffee pot. Just</p> 

<p>enough boiling water is poured on to moisten and swell</p> 

<p>the grains. Add boiling water, a spoonful or two at a</p> 

<p>time, and repeat at intervals until the quantity desired</p> 

<p>has "dripped" to the lower container ofthe coffee pot. To</p> 

<p>keep contents hot until needed, the pot may be set in a</p> 

<p>pan of simmering water.</p> 

<br>

<p>Cafe brulot (pronounced ca-fay' broo'lo) takes its name</p> 

<p>from two French words—cafe, or "coffee," and brulot,</p> 

<p>which has dual meanings . . . "highly seasoned" and "in</p> 

<p>cendiary or burning." Both fit the brulot perfectly. In</p> 

<p>other words, it is "burnt spiced coffee."</p> 

<p>Dorothy Dix, who often stirs a brMot at the home of</p> 

<p>this writer, calls the delectable brew "liquid fruit cake."</p>

<h3>Antoine Special</h3> 
<br>
<p>154 jiggers Dubonnet wine</p> 

<p>1J4 jiggers French vermouth</p> 

<br>

<p>The Dubonnet is poured into a wine or flip glass, and the ver-</p> 

<p>mouth skillfully "floated" on—not mixed. This appetizer is best</p> 

<p>without the addition of bitters or even ice. The flavor of the</p> 

<p>Dubonnet is improved by chilling—but avoid diluting with </p> 

<p>ice cubes.</p> 
<br>
<p>This is the aperitif featured by Antoine's, oldest and</p> 

<p>most celebrated French restaurant in New Orleans. It</p> 

<p>was Jules Alciatore, son of Antoine Alciatore founder of</p> 

<p>the famous rendezvous of gourmets, who originated this</p> 

<p>inspiring before-dinner appetizer. Simple to make—easy</p> 

<p>to take . . . there your are; one whiff of this rhythmic</p> 

<p>fluid makes poets of us all.</p> 
<br>
<p>Jules, like his illustrious sire, has passed on to his well-</p> 

<p>deserved reward. But when you dine at this St. Louis</p> 

<p>street shrine to Epicurus you will flatter the house by</p> 

<p>specifying Antoine Special as your appetizer.</p> 
<br>

<h3>Syrup Cup</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 lump sugar</p> 

<p>1/2 lemon—juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger cherry hrandy</p> 

<p>1 jigger cognac brandy</p> 

<p>1 maraschino cherry</p> 
<br>
<p>When you have dissolved the sugar in a little water add </p> 

<p>the lemon juice, and the two brandies. Stir with ice and </p> 

<p>strain into a cock tail glass. Drop in the cherry.</p> 
<br>
<p>It occurs to us that in a day when the motorcars have</p> 

<p>outstripped horseflesh, "runningboard" cocktail would be</p> 

<p>a more suitable name for this delectable parting cup.</p> 

<p>The above recipe compounds a farewell drink potent</p> 

<p>enough to make you fancy yourself on a horse, feet in</p>

<p>Father, mother, sister, brother we cannot tell a lie—this</p>

<h3>Ambrosia</h3>

<p>1 lemon juice only</p> 

<p>champagne</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix all but the champagne and pour into a thin 6-ouncc glass.</p> 

<p>The mixture will half fill the glass. Pour in the champagne</p> 

<p> as well. </p>
<br>
<p>Ambrosia is popularly supposed to have been the drink</p> 

<p>concocted by the Greek gods on Mount Olympus, and</p> 

<p>was calculated to put sparkle in Grecian ladies eyes and</p> 

<p>hair on Grecian gentlemen's chests. At Arnaud's, one of</p> 

<p>the better French restaurants in New Orleans' Vieux</p> 

<p>CarrS, a modern version ofthe Mount Olympus is served.</p> 
<br>
<p>We have it from the proprietor, Arnaud Cazenave</p> 

<p>("Count Arnaud" to his familiars) that the ambrosia he</p> 

<p>brews is one the lovely Hebe might well have served</p> 

<p>Juno, Jupiter, Ganymede, and the balance of the Olym-</p> 

<p>pus crowd. We who have sampled it agree.</p> 

<br>

<p>(Note by our dietetics editor: Ambrosia was the food</p>

<p>A Goodly Countrey . . . abounding with wild Date trees , . .</p> 

<p>whence they draw a liquor called Tarrie." 1609.</p> 

<p>Toddies, Clings, and Flips</p> 

<p>While we apply the name Toddy to that drink in</p> 

<p>which we mix whiskey, gin, rum, or brandy with a little</p> 

<p>-sugared water, the original toddy was a far different</p> 

<p>drink from that which we now imbibe under the same</p> 

<p>name.</p> 
<br>
<p>"Toddy" originally was the fermented sap obtained</p> 

<p>from the incised spathes of various species of palms,</p> 

<p>especially the wild date palm, and used as a beverage in</p> 

<p>tropical countries. A Hindustani word, tart in the begin-</p> 

<p>ing, it later became tarrie, then tary, terry, tadie, taddy,</p> 

<p>toddey, toddie and, finally as we know it today, toddy.</p> 

<p>Toddy is just another name for Sling, or vice versa.</p> 

<p>For example a Hot Whiskey Sling calls for a lump of</p> 

<p>sugar in a half-glassful of boiling water, a jigger of</p> 

<p>whiskey, a small piece of lemon peel and a grating of</p> 

<p>nutmeg. Now if you want a Hot Whiskey Toddy, du</p> 

<p>plicate the above and omit the nutmeg.</p> 
<br>
<p>Some like'em hot, some like'em cold, some like'em</p> 

<p>with gin, some with brandy, some with Scotch. But in</p> 

<p>any case the addition or omission of nutmeg makes the</p> 

<p>difference between toddy and sling.</p> 

<p>The Kentucky Toddy is composed of a lump of sugar,</p> 

<p>a little water, a twist of lemon peel, a full jigger of Bour-</p> 

<p>bon, a lump of ice, and a lot of stirring.</p> 

<p>"Toddy, originally the juice of the cocoa tree and afterwards</p> 

<p>t^rn, water, sugar, and nutmeg." 1788.</p>

<b>Flips</b> 

<p>The Flip was at one time a hot drink served in an</p> 

<p>earthenware mug, much favored in England and Amer-</p> 

<p>ica before tea and coffee came into common use. The</p> 

<p>drink was composed of ale, egg, nutmeg, sugar, ginger,</p> 

<p>and brandy or rum. It was made sizzling hot by heating</p> 

<p>an iron loggerhead, or flip-dog, in the fire until it was</p> 

<p>red-hot and thrusting the heated end into the mug of</p> 

<p>mixed liquor, whence a sound like "Sz-z-z-t!" resulted,</p> 

<p>and a vapor like heaven arose.</p> 
<br>
<p>The flips of today have gone cold, and the flip-dog re-</p> 

<p>mains chilled and neglected by the fireplace, its solitary</p> 

<p>use now to poke the burning logs. Ice has taken the</p> 

<p>place of heat in the various concoctions carrying the anci-</p> 

<p>ent name. Some of these, relics of a past, are given be</p> 

<p>low.</p> 
<br>
<p>Ale Flip: Beat up an egg with a half-teaspoon of sugar,</p> 

<p>fill the glass with ale, mix well with a spoon and grate</p> 

<p>nutmeg on top.</p> 
<br>
<p>Brandy Flip: Fill the glass half-full with crushed ice.</p> 

<p>Put in one egg, one jigger brandy, a teaspoon of sugar.</p> 

<p>Beat until it froths and grate nutmeg on top.</p> 

<p>In similar manner is made a Rum Flip, a Gin Flip, a</p> 

<p>Sherry Flip, or a Whiskey Flip. A Yankee Flip has a</p> 

<p>jigger of apple brandy added to the egg and sugar. All</p> 

<p>must be topped with grated nutmeg.</p>

<p>spirit, and water, sweetened and flavored," and had noth-</p> 

<p>ing to do with "the slings and arrows of outrageous for</p> 

<p>tune," so feelingly bespoken by Hamlet in his morose-</p> 

<p>soliloquy.</p> 
<br>
<p>As long ago as 1788 a certain shipwrecked scribe re-</p> 

<p>corded that he and his mates found "a case-bottle filled</p> 

<p>with Holland's [gin], of which each of us took a sling."</p> 

<p>This indicates the word originally had the same mean-</p> 

<p>ing as "draught," "pull," or "swig," as Americans de-</p> 

<p>scribe the swigging of a healthy mouthful from a jug.</p> 

<p>A Bitter Sling, quite a favorite in the old days as an</p> 

<p>electioneering potion, was described in 1806 thus: "a</p> 

<p>stimulating liquor composed of spirits of any kind, sugar,</p> 

<p>water, and bitters."</p> 
<br>

<h3>Singapore Sling</h3> 
<br>
<p>1/2 jigger dry gin</p> 

<p>54 jigger apricot brandy</p> 

<p>54 jigger cherry brandy</p> 

<p>54 lime juice only</p> 

<p>seltzer water</p> 
<br>
<p>To sling this drink you must first provide yourself with</p> 

<p> a highball glass nearly filled with cracked ice. </p> 

<p>In it squeeze the juice of a lime, then add the </p>

<p>gin, cherry brandy, bencdictine, and all that</p> 

<p>can go in of seltzer water. Frappe with a spoon, or in a shaker.</p> 

<p>Garnish with fruit.</p> 
<br>
<p>This is a drink that makes you itch to travel—or any</p> 

<p>way step out. In olden times a drink was slung from</p> 

<p>one mug to another in mixing, and that's how the Sling</p> 

<p>derived its name. The word itself came from the Low</p> 

<p>German slingen, which means to swallow.</p> 

<p>Here's slinging at you.</p>

<h3>Sloe Gin Singapore Sling</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 jigger sloe gin</p> 

<p>1/2 jigger dry gin</p> 

<p>1/2 jigger apricot brandy</p> 

<p>1/2 jigger cherry brandy</p> 

<p>1/2 lime—juice only</p> 

<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix in a 12-ounce highball glass. First the sugar, then the lime</p> 

<p>juice, the two brandies, the two gins. Stir, fill two-thirds with</p> 

<p>cracked ice, and fill to the brim with seltzer. Decorate with a</p> 

<p>slice of orange, a slice of pineapple, and a cherry.</p> 
<br>
<h3>Stone Fence</h3> 
<br>

<p>1 whiskey</p> 

<p>sweet cider</p> 

<p>3 lumps ice</p> 
<br>
<p>Pour the jigger of whiskey in a tall glass,  </p> 

<p>drop in the three lumps or cubes of ice and fill to the </p> 

<p>brim with the unfermented cider. All left to do is to stir</p> 

<p> and sip. Washington Irving, in his Diedrich Knickerbocker's</p> 

<p>History of New York, claimed the Dutch-Americans</p> 

<p>were inventors of "sherry-cobbler" and "stone-face," and</p> 

<p>in 1809 Irving also claimed that the original settlers of</p> 

<p>New Amsterdam were responsible for the naming of the</p> 

<p>"cocktail."</p> 
<br>
<p>Why whiskey and sweet cider, joined in holy wetlock</p> 

<p>should figure under so unemotional a name as "stone-</p> 

<p>fence" is matter for deliberation. One punster quips:</p> 

<p>"Drink enough and you'll overcome all obstacles and</p> 

<p>never take offense."</p> 
<br>
<p>Originally the name "stone-fence" was applied to an</p> 

<p>applejack and sweet cider combination, and those in the</p> 

<p>know will tell you that as sweet cider ferments it de-</p> 

<p>velops into applejack.</p> 

<p>However it may develop one thing is certain it's one</p> 

<p>of the hard liquors that is powerfully easy to take.</p>

<p>"A glass of swizzle, the most salubrius beverage in</p> 

<p>hot weather." 1843.</p> 
<br> 
<h3>Swizzle</h3> 
<br>
<p>The name Swizzle has been applied to variously com-</p> 

<p>pounded drinks, and while it is said the origin of the</p> 

<p>word is unknown it appears to be just another way of</p> 

<p>pronouncing Switchel, a drink made of molasses and</p> 

<p>water, sometime with the addition of vinegar, gin, and</p> 

<p>rum. Also applied to strong drinks sweetened and</p> 

<p>flavored with bitters.</p> 
<br>
<p>To make a Swizzle a swizzle-stick is necessary a</p> 

<p>round wooden stick or dowel with swollen bottom end</p> 

<p>from which protrude five smaller sticks like the spokes</p> 

<p>of a wheel. The swizzle-stick is rotated rapidly between</p> 

<p>the palms to mix the drink thoroughly. A Swizzle,</p> 

<p>according to legend, is a liquid institution of Demerara,</p> 

<p>British Guiana, and became quite popular in the West </p> 

<p>Indies before it made its appearance in Old New Orleans.</p> 

<p>There were many references to the drink over a century</p> 

<p>ago, such as "The boys finished the evening with some</p> 

<p>fine grub, swizzle, and singing." (1813), and a British</p> 

<p>traveler. Lady Brassy, more intrigued with the way the</p> 

<p>drink was concocted with a swizzle-stick than with the</p> 

<p>drink itself, wrote in 1885: "I mean to take home some</p> 

<p>'swizzle-sticks.' They are cut from some kind of creeper,</p> 

<p>close to a joint, where four or five shoots branch out at</p> 

<p>right angles, so as to produce a star-like circle. The whole</p> 

<p>is mixed with powdered ice, and stirred or 'swizzled' until</p> 

<p>it froths well."</p> 

<br>

<p>As early as 1800 this same drink was known as Swit-</p> 

<p>chel, an Englishman noting that "the dauntless Yankees</p> 

<p>still drank their switchell," so that derivation of stvizzel</p> 

<p>from stvitchel seems plain.</p> 

<p>"We were never 'groggy', 'intoxicated', 'swizzled', or 'tight',</p> 

<p>but once." 1843.</p>

<h3>Swizzle</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 wineglass rum</p> 

<p>1 tablespoon "New Orleans" molasses</p> 

<p>1 pony water</p> 

<p>2-3 dashes Peychaud bitters</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix in a barglass, swizzle with a swizzle-stick, add ice,</p> 

<p> swizzle again. Strain into a serving glass.</p> 

<p>This is the summer swizzle; in the wintertime piping</p> 

<p>hot water is added to the rum and molasses. Rotate</p> 

<p>with the swizzle-stick, and grate a little nutmeg on top.</p> 

<p>Serve the hot drink in the mixing glass.</p> 
<br>
<h3>Sangaree</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 

<p>1 jigger port wine</p> 

<p>nutmeg</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix the sugar with the port wine before </p> 

<p>filling the mixing glass nearly full of fine ice. </p>

<p>Stir vigorously, or put the mixture in a</p> 

<p>shaker. Strain into a thin glass and grate a litde nutmeg </p> 

<p>on top. While the original recipe for Sangaree calls for port</p> 

<p>wine, it is sometimes made with brandy, sherry, gin, or</p> 

<p>even ale. The drink is a tropical one and because of its</p> 

<p>color derives its name from the French sang, meaning</p> 

<p>"blood." We are also told the name "sangaree" fits any</p> 

<p>drink, so long as it's red, and made of wine and</p> 

<p>sweetened water, then spiced and iced. The drink is an</p> 

<p>old-fashioned one and was very popular as a guest re-</p> 

<p>freshment in old Creole davs.</p>

<h3>Punches</h3> 
<br>
<p>Punch is the ideal beverage to serve at large gatherings</p> 

<p>and many are the kinds from which to choose when you</p> 

<p>are preparing to entertain in a big way.</p> 
<br>
<p>The Punch Bowl, or Bowl O'Punch, as our English</p> 

<p>cousins call it, has long been a feature of Christmas and</p> 

<p>holiday festivities. The word punch comes from India,</p> 

<p>and is derived from the Hindu panch, meaning five, the</p> 

<p>original beverage being composed of five ingredients:</p> 

<p>spirits, water or milk, lemon, sugar, spice or cordial.</p> 

<p>The punch field is covered by arrack, brandy, claret, gin,</p> 

<p>milk, rum, tea, whiskey, wine, and fruit punch. The</p> 

<p>drink is usuallv qualified by the name of the principal</p> 

<p>ingredient, as, for example, whiskey punch.</p> 
<br>

<h3>St. Charles Punch</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 teaspoon sugar</p> 

<p>1 lemon—juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger port wine</p> 

<p>1 pony cognac brandy</p> 

<p>1/3 teaspoon curagao</p> 
<br>
<p>Dissolve the sugar with a little water in a mixing glass. Add</p> 

<p>the lemon juice, the port wine, the cognac, and last the curagao.</p> 

<p>Fill the glass with fine ice and jiggle with the barspoon. Pour</p> 

<p>into a long thin glass, garnish with fruit, and serve with a </p> 

<p>straw.</p>
<br>
<p>Years ago this was a famed punch very much in </p> 

<p>demand at the celebrated St. Charles Hotel bar. Don't</p> 

<p>omit the straw; this drink demands long and deliberate</p> 

<p>sipping for consummate enjoyment.</p>

<h3>Orgeat Punch</h3> 
<br>
<p>54 jigger orgeat syrup</p> 

<p>1 lemon juice only</p> 

<p>54 lime juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey</p> 

<p>1 dash orange bitters</p> 

<p>1 pony port wine</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix all but the port in the order named in a tall 12-ounce</p> 

<p>glass. Fill wtih cracked ice</p>

<p> to a finger-width of the top. Jiggle with a</p> 

<p>spoon until well frapped. Then float on top the pony of port</p> 

<p>wine ... do not stir.</p> 
<br>
<p>Says Sam Guarino, chief bartender at the Hotel Roose</p> 

<p>velt bar, who originated this drink delight, "The Orgeat</p> 

<p>Punch has two distinct flavors which register separately</p> 

<p>when trickling down your throat. First you taste the</p> 

<p>Oporto, then you get the second rich taste of the orgeat</p> 

<p>flavored whiskey mixture."</p> 
<br>
<p>Orgeat syrup, or syrop d'orgeat, is made from the milk</p> 

<p>of almonds and has long been a favorite flavoring and</p> 

<p>sweetening liqueur among the Creoles of New Orleans.</p> 

<p>It is not used as much today as in the past, but drink-</p> 

<p>mixers who like something different should cultivate its</p> 

<p>acquaintance again.</p> 
<br>
<h3>Arrack Punch</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 jigger date arrack</p> 

<p>2 teaspoons bar sugar</p> 

<p>2 dashes lemon juice</p> 
<br>
<p>Dissolve the sugar in a little water, add the lemon juice, then </p> 

<p>the arrack; fill the glass nearly full with shaved ice,</p> 

<p>and shake well. Strain into a glass and serve with a straw.</p> 
<br>
<p>Arrack is the fermented juice of the date palm, and</p> 

<p>is a name that was applied in Eastern countries to any</p> 

<p>spirituous liquor of native manufacture, especially ones</p> 

<p>distilled from the fermented sap of the coco-palm, or</p> 

<p>from rice and sugar fermented with cocoanut juice. Later</p>

<br> 

<p>the arrack imported from Batavia and Japan was con-</p> 

<p>sidered' superior in concocting the punch, at which time</p> 

<p>the name arrack was shortened to "Rack."</p> 
<br>
<p>Arrack punch was a favorite tipple in the New Orleans</p> 

<p>of the splendid idle 40's when flourished W. J.</p> 

<p>Logan's "Pelican" coffee-house "at Gravier and Union in</p> 

<p>the rear of Clapp's Church," as he always advertised his</p> 

<p>place. The Pelican's specialties were Arrack Punch and</p> 

<p>Pineapple Julep, both mixed in huge bowls and prepared</p> 

<p>fresh every day. As a punch it bears no resemblance</p> 

<p>to the mixtures we now call by that name, and the Pine</p> 

<p>apple Julep of Host Logan came nearer being a punch</p> 

<p>than the drink designated today as julep.</p> 
<br>
<h3>Pineapple Julep</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 quart sparkling Moselle wine</p> 

<p>2 jiggers dry gin</p> 

<p>2 jiggers maraschino sirup</p> 

<p>2 jiggers raspberry sirup</p> 

<p>2 oranges—juice only</p> 

<p>sugar to taste</p> 

<p>slices pineapple</p> 
<br>
<p>This punch, for it is not really a julep according to our modern</p> 

<p>acceptation of the term julep, should be prepared by placing a</p> 

<p>large piece of ice in a punch bowl and pouring on the mixture</p> 

<p>then ladling it over the ice long enough to melt some of the ice</p> 

<p>and chill the whole. The pineapple should be the fresh fruit, if</p> 

<p>possible, and sliced over the bowl. Cherries from the maraschino</p> 

<p>bottle, strawberries, and other fruits in season can be added.</p>
<br> 

<p>This recipe makes enough for six servings.</p> 

<p>In the days of old, the days of gold, and the days of</p> 

<p>'49, when embryonic miners flocked through New Orleans</p> 

<p>on their way to the newly-discovered California</p> 

<p>gold fields, these same would-be miners found many</p>

<p>places in the Crescent City to wet their whistles. One</p> 

<p>popular oasis was Logan's "Pelican CoflFee-house," told</p> 

<p>of in the foregoing page, where the Arrack Punch and</p> 

<p>Pineapple Julep were counted the best in town.</p> 
<br>
<h3>Louisiana Party Punch</h3> 
<br>
<p>1 quart rum</p> 

<p>1 pint lemon juice</p> 

<p>1 pint strong tea</p> 

<p>2 pints carbonated water</p> 

<p>1/2 pound granulated sugar</p> 
<br>
<p>This recipe makes one gallon of punch—sufficient for</p> 

<p>12 guests, depending upon capacity. Make the tea quite</p> 

<p>strong and allow it to cool. Mix the ingredients and</p> 

<p>pour into a gallon jug the day before serving as this will</p> 

<p>promote blending and enhance the flavor and bouquet</p> 

<p>of the punch. Have it well chilled by placing the jug</p> 

<p>in the ice box.</p> 
<br>
<p>When party time arrives put a large piece of ice in</p> 

<p>the punch bowl with slices of orange and lemon and</p> 

<p>other fruits in season. Serve to your guests in regulation</p> 

<p>5-ounce punch cups.</p>

<p>The Wassail Bowl</p> 
<br>
<p>The Wassail Bowl contained liquor in which healths</p> 

<p>were' drunk in the long ago, the favorite content being</p> 

<p>the spiced ale used in Christmas eve and Twelfth-night</p> 

<p>celebrations. The custom of brewing a Wassail bowl</p> 

<p>has fallen into disuse and is revived only rarely.</p> 

<p>The word "Wassail" used of old when presenting a</p> 

<p>cup of wine, or drinking a comrade's health, carried the</p> 

<p>same meaning as "hail" and "farewell." The reply to</p> 

<p>the salutation "Wassail," when presenting the bowl of</p> 

<p>wine, was "Drink-hail," in accepting it.</p> 

<p>Sang Sir Walter Scott in his Lay of the Last Minstrel</p> 

<p>"The blithesome signs of wassel gay, Decayed not with</p> 

<p>the dying day."</p> 
<br>
<h3>Wassail Bowl</h3> 
<br>
<p>2 baked apples</p> 

<p>2 tablespoons fine sugar</p> 

<p>1 tablespoon allspice</p> 

<p>1 lemon, juice and peel</p> 

<p>1 quart hot ale</p> 

<p>1 pint warm sherry</p> 
<br>
<p>To make the Wassail Bowl bake two apples and cut in small</p> 

<p>pieces. Add the sugar, the allspice, the lemon, the heated ale,</p> 

<p>and warm sherry. Mix well, mashing with a muddler, heat and</p> 

<p>serve hot.</p> 
<br>
<p>The Wassail Bowl is as significant of Christmas as is</p> 

<p>St. Nicholas himself. After sampling, who shall say</p> 

<p>there ain't no Santa Claus? Perhaps, indeed, it was the</p> 

<p>original Wassail Bowl that inspired this loveliest myth</p> 

<p>of childhood, when out of good fellowship engendered</p> 

<p>by the mellowing Christmas brew, the spirit of Christ</p> 

<p>mas took shape in the hearts of men.</p>

<p>Hail the Wassail Bowl! We know there's a Santa Claus! 	</p>

<h3>Eggnogs</h3> 
<br>
<p>As long ago as in the period when Shakppeare wrote</p> 

<p>his plays we find chronicled: "Nog is a kind of strong</p> 

<p>beer brewed in East Anglia." In writings two hundred</p> 

<p>years later we find records of such a brew as egg-nog</p> 

<p>in which "the white and yolk of eggs are stirred with</p> 

<p>hot beer, cider, wine, or spirits."</p> 
<br>
<p>In 1825 New Yorkers read in a newspaper called</p> 

<p>Brother Jonathan, that the "egg-nog had gone about</p> 

<p>rather freely" at a certain party. A score of years later</p> 

<p>A. O. Hall, stopping at the old St. Charles Hotel while in</p> 

<p>the Crescent City gathering material for his Manhattaner</p> 

<p>in New Orleans, popular book of its day, "trembled to</p> 

<p>rhinlf of the juleps, and punches, and nogs, and soups,</p>      

<p>consumed in the dining-room of that famed hostelry.</p> 

<p>Much liquor has flowed over the bars since Nog was</p> 

<p>originally described as an ale brewed in East Anglia,</p> 

<p>now modern Norfolk and Suffolk in England. Every</p> 

<p>egg-nog recipe today calls for milk or cream, none for</p> 

<p>ale or hot beer. Time changes everything. Blessed be</p>

<br>
<p>1 barspoon sugar</p> 

<p>1/2 lemon juice only</p> 

<p>1 jigger rye whiskey</p> 
<br>
<p>Mix in a barglass. Fill with cracked ice. Clap on the shaker</p> 

<p>and shake vigorously before straining into a cocktail glass.</p> 

<p>This is the drink a Frenchman had in mind when he</p> 

<p>walked into a New Orleans cocktail lounge and said to</p> 

<p>the man behind the bar:</p> 

<p>^Mix for rne, sil vous plait, a contradictions."</p> 

<p>which? demanded the puzzled barkeep.</p> 

<p>"the great Americain drink—a contradictions."</p> 

<p>Never heard of it, mister . . . how's it made?"</p> 
<br>
<p>You use whiskey to make eet strong; water to make</p> 

<p>eet weak; lemon juice to make eet sour, and sugar to make</p> 

<p>it sweet, explained the French visitor. "Zen you say:</p> 

<p>Here to you, and you drink eet yourself! Zat, sar, ees</p> 

<p>zee contradictions."</p> 
<br>

<p>Where upon the barkeep mixed the drink-which you</p> 

<p>will have no difficulty in recognizing as the old reliable</p> 

<p>time-tested Whiskey Sour.</p>

<p>Longevity
The horse and mule live thirty years 	
And nothing know of wines and beers; 	
The goat and sheep at twenty die 	
And never taste of Scotch or Rye; 	
The cow drinks water by the ton 	
And at eighteen is mostly done; 	
The dog at fifteen cashes in 	
And without the aid of rum or gin; 	
The cat in milk and water soaks 	
And then in twelve short years it croaks; 	
The modest, sober, bone-dry hen 	
Lays eggs for nogs, then dies at ten. 	
All animals are strictly dry. 	
They sinless live and swiftly die. 	
But sinful, ginful, rum-soaked 	men— 	
Survive for three-score years and ten! 	
	 If.
